                                    <p>Below are answers to frequently asked questions about the interMission community. If you have additional questions not covered here, please feel free to reach out.</p>

                                    <h2>What exactly will we do when we gather?</h2>
                                    <p>Our first meeting will include brief introductions, covenant signing, discussion of life story preparation, an explanation of how we'll approach prayer together, and dedicated time in prayer.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Beginning with week two, our gatherings will follow a consistent rhythm: we'll open with prayer, spend an hour listening to one person's life story, then briefly reflect on the previous week's spiritual practices and introduce the coming week's exercises.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Once everyone has shared their life story, our weekly gatherings will center on prayer, honest reflection about our experiences with the week's practices, and learning about the spiritual disciplines we'll explore together in the days ahead.</p>

                                    <h2>When and where will we meet?</h2>
                                    <p>The specific day and time will be determined based on the schedules of those who submit <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=DQSIkWdsW0yxEjajBLZtrQAAAAAAAAAAAAN__pR0NPpUMTVRU01ERTdSVFRQRVpTNUxZMEw4SjFMVS4u">applications</a> and priority will be given based on when the applications were submitted. Since I work full-time and weekends tend to be unpredictable for most people, we'll likely meet one evening, Tuesday through Friday, sometime between 6:00 and 10:00 PM. Once I hear from interested participants, we'll find a time that works for the majority of our community. Tentatively, I imagine meeting in my home near Magnuson Park.</p>

                                    <h2>What does this cost, and how do I pay?</h2>
                                    <p>Participation in interMission will cost you up to seven hours of active engagement per week—two hours for our gathering plus up to five hours for personal spiritual practices. The only financial investment is purchasing a journal and pen for your personal use throughout our journey.</p>

                                    <h2>How many people can join, and how will I know if there's still space?</h2>
                                    <p>For practical reasons, we'll cap the group at 12 people, including myself as facilitator. Priority will be given based on when people submit their application forms. During the summer, I'll follow up with everyone who has expressed interest to confirm availability and determine a meeting day that works for the majority. When we reach capacity, I'll post a clear notice on the home page.</p>

                                    <h2>Do I need to be a Christian to participate?</h2>
                                    <p>You don't need to be a Christian, but you do need to understand that all our practices are grounded in and centered on Jesus Christ. If you're genuinely seeking to learn about and encounter Jesus, we warmly welcome you! However, if you're looking for a spiritual community that treats all faith traditions as equally valid, this journey probably isn't the right fit.</p>

                                    <h2>I'm a new(ish) follower of Jesus. Is this appropriate for me?</h2>
                                    <p>Absolutely! There's zero expectation that you've experienced any of the spiritual practices we'll explore together. My hope is that the combination of community, prayer, learning, and practice will offer something substantial to people at every stage of their faith journey—whether you've been following Jesus for decades or just beginning to explore what that means.</p>

                                    <h2>Is there an age limit or target demographic?</h2>
                                    <p>No age restrictions! My dream would be to have participants ranging from 18 to 120. As long as you're in some kind of life transition and want to dedicate this season to Jesus, you're an excellent candidate. However, due to the significant time commitment, there are probably seasons in life when this wouldn't be practical. Since our gatherings are designed to be a sacred commitment, if work, family, or community obligations would prevent you from attending weekly and practicing at home, it's probably best to wait for a more suitable season.</p>

                                    <h2>What if I miss a week?</h2>
                                    <p>As stated in our covenant, we hope weekly gatherings will be a priority in your schedule. However, we understand that emergencies arise and life happens. If you're unable to attend, please give as much advance notice as possible. We also encourage you to continue the week's spiritual practices at home so you can share similar experiences with the community when you return.</p>

                                    <h2>Will we eat together or do other social activities?</h2>
                                    <p>Participants are absolutely welcomed and encouraged to schedule meals or social events outside our scheduled meeting time. However, our two-hour gatherings will be food and snack free, allowing us to focus entirely on the spiritual work before us.</p>

                                    <h2>What happens after our final gathering?</h2>
                                    <p>My hope is that by journey's end, you'll love Jesus more fervently, have adopted life-giving spiritual practices, or gained clearer vision for what God is calling you to in your next season—ideally all three! This is designed as a formative experience rather than an ongoing community group, so our final gathering will likely mark the end of your participation in this particular community.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>One exception: if there's growing interest in future interMission communities and you feel called to leadership, there's potential for a progression where participants become co-leaders the following year, then lead independently in year three. But the primary goal is your spiritual formation during this concentrated season together.</p>
