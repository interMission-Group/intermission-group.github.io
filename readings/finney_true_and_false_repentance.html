    TRUE AND FALSE REPENTANCE

    Introduction
</h2>
<p>
    <em>
        "Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to  salvation and leaves no
        regret, but worldly sorrow brings death. See what this  godly sorrow has
        produced in you: what earnestness, what eagerness to clear  yourselves,
        what indignation, what alarm, what longing, what concern, what
        readiness to see justice done. At every point you have proved yourselves
        to be  innocent in this matter."
    </em>
    - 2 Corinthians 7:10-11 (NIV)
</p>
<p>
    True repentance involves changing your mind about the nature  of sin,
    followed by a corresponding change in how you feel about sin. Feelings
    result from thoughts. When this change of opinion produces a matching change
    of  feeling—if the opinion is correct and the feeling matches—this is true
    repentance. The godly sorrow that God requires must come from His
    perspective  on sin.
</p>
<p>
    To someone who truly repents, sin looks completely different  than it does
    to someone who hasn't repented. Instead of looking appealing or  attractive,
    it looks disgusting and detestable. They're amazed that they ever  could
    have wanted such a thing. Unrepentant sinners may look at sin and see  that
    it will destroy them because God will punish them for it, but it still
    appears desirable in itself. They love it. If it could lead to happiness,
    they  would never think of giving up their sin.
</p>
<p>
    But someone who truly repents looks at their own behavior as  completely
    hateful. They look back and say, "How detestable and deserving  of hell my
    sin was."
</p>
<p>
    Sinners don't understand why God threatens sin with such  terrible
    punishment. They love it so much that they can't see why God thinks it
    deserves eternal judgment. When sinners are strongly convicted, they see sin
    the same way a Christian does. Then all they need is a corresponding change
    in  feeling to be saved.
</p>
<p>
    Many sinners think about their relationship to God and know  they deserve
    eternal death, but their heart doesn't agree with God's judgment.  This is
    the case with demons and evil spirits in hell. A change of opinion is
    essential to true repentance and always comes before it. There may be a
    change  of opinion without repentance, but no genuine repentance happens
    without a  change of opinion.
</p>
<p>
    The unsaved sinner thinks it's completely unbelievable that  sin deserves
    eternal death. They may be fully convinced, however, to see that  sin hurts
    themselves and everyone else, and that there's no solution but  complete
    abstinence. Even the devil knows this is true.
</p>
<p>
    The word translated "repentance" implies a change  of opinion about what sin
    justly deserves. The careless sinner has almost no  correct ideas about the
    just punishment of sin. Even if they admit  theoretically that sin deserves
    eternal death, they don't believe it. If they  believed it, it would be
    impossible for them to remain a careless sinner.  They're deceived if they
    think they honestly hold the opinion that sin deserves  God's eternal wrath.
</p>
<p>
    The truly awakened and convicted sinner sees clearly that  sin deserves
    everlasting punishment from God. To them, it's simply a fact.
</p>
<h2 id="change-of-heart">
    A CHANGE OF HEART
</h2>
<p>
    In true repentance, there must be a corresponding change of  feeling. This
    change of feeling concerns sin in its nature, its functions, its
    tendencies, and its outcome. The person who truly repents not only sees sin
    as  detestable, vile, and worthy of hatred, but actually hates it in their
    heart. A  person may see sin as harmful and disgusting and still love it,
    desire it, and  cling to it. But when they truly repent, they wholeheartedly
    hate and reject  it.
</p>
<p>
    This causes those tears of sorrow that sometimes pour out  when Christians
    see sin in its true nature. When a believer views sin in  relation to God,
    they feel like weeping. Springs of sorrow gush forth, and they  want to get
    down on their face and pour out a flood of tears over their sin.
</p>
<p>
    When a believer views sin in its tendencies, it awakens a  burning desire to
    stop it and save people from their sins. Their heart is set  on fire, and
    they pray with all their strength to pull sinners out of hell and  save them
    from the awful consequences of sin. It's as if they saw everyone  taking
    poison that would destroy them. They lift up their voice and scream,  "Watch
    out!"
</p>
<p>
    They have an intellectual conviction that sin deserves  everlasting
    punishment and are amazed that God can forgive them. Instead of  thinking it
    harsh or unkind that sinners are sent to hell, they're full of  wondering
    praise that they themselves aren't sent to hell. And when they think  of
    such a sinner being saved, they feel gratitude unlike any they've ever
    known. If your repentance is genuine, you have a conscious change of views
    and  feelings about sin. Can you say this? Do you know that there has been a
    change  in you and that old things have passed away and all things have
    become new?
</p>
<p>
    When repentance is genuine, the prevailing tendency to sin  again is gone.
    If you have truly repented, you don't love sin now. You don't  abstain from
    it through fear or to avoid punishment, but because you hate it.  Look at
    the sins you used to practice. How do they appear to you? Do they look
    pleasant, and would you really love to practice them again if you dared? If
    you  still have the desire to sin, you're only convicted. Your opinions of
    sin may  be changed, but if the love of that sin remains, you're still an
    unrepentant  sinner.
</p>
<p>
    The Scripture says, "Godly sorrow produces  repentance." Godly sorrow
    produces a change in behavior. Otherwise, it's  like saying that repentance
    produces repentance. But repentance must be a  change of mind that produces
    a change of behavior and leads to salvation. Have  you abandoned your sins?
    Or are you still practicing them? If so, you're still  a sinner. You may
    have changed your mind, but if you haven't changed your  behavior, it's not
    godly repentance.
</p>
<h2 id="repentance-leading-to-salvation">
    REPENTANCE LEADING TO SALVATION
</h2>
<p>
    Genuine repentance leads to confession and making things  right. The thief
    hasn't repented while he keeps the money he stole. He may have  conviction
    but no repentance. If he had truly repented, he would go and give  back the
    money. If you have cheated anyone and don't restore what you've taken,  or
    if you have injured anyone and don't undo the wrong, you haven't truly
    repented.
</p>
<p>
    True repentance is a permanent change of character and  conduct. The text
    says it's repentance "not to be regretted." True  repentance is so deep and
    fundamental that the person never changes back again.  People often quote it
    as if it read "repentance that doesn't need to be  regretted." But it says,
    "not to be regretted" and is so  thorough that there's no going back. The
    love of sin is totally abandoned. Any  person who has truly repented has
    changed their views and feelings and will not  change back to loving sin.
    The truly repentant sinner exercises feelings they  will never
    regret—"leading to salvation." The very reason it ends in  salvation is
    because it will not be regretted.
</p>
<p>
    False repentance is the sorrow of the world: sorrow for sin  arising from
    worldly considerations and motives connected with this present  life. At
    best, false repentance cares about the person's own happiness in a  future
    world and has no regard for the true nature of sin.
</p>
<p>
    False repentance is not founded on a change of opinion like  true
    repentance. A person may see the evil consequences of sin from a worldly
    point of view, and it may fill them with anxiety. They may see that it will
    greatly damage their reputation or endanger their life. If their secrets
    were  discovered, they would be disgraced—this may fill them with fear and
    distress.  People often have this kind of sorrow when some worldly
    consideration is at the  bottom of it.
</p>
<p>
    Selfishness is at the root of false repentance. It may be a  strong feeling
    of regret in the person's mind. They see the evil consequences  of their
    actions, and it makes them miserable or exposes them to God's wrath.  Sin
    may hurt their family, friends, or themselves in time or eternity. All this
    is pure selfishness.
</p>
<p>
    They may feel remorse of conscience—biting, consuming  remorse—and have no
    true repentance. It may extend to deep and dreadful fear of  God's wrath and
    the pains of hell but be purely selfish. All the while there  may be no
    hatred of sin and no feelings of the heart convicted of the infinite  evil
    of sin.
</p>
<p>
    False repentance leaves the feelings unchanged and the  desire to sin in the
    heart unbroken and uncontrolled. The feelings about the  nature of sin are
    not changed, and the person still feels a desire to sin. They  abstain from
    it not from hatred of it but from dread of its consequences.
</p>
<p>
    The person who has exercised true repentance is willing to  admit that they
    have repented and that they were a sinner. The person who  falsely repents
    resorts to excuses and lies to cover their sins and is ashamed  of their
    repentance. They will cover up their sins with a thousand apologies  and
    excuses, trying to smooth them over and diminish their enormity. If they
    speak of their past conduct, they always do it in the gentlest and most
    favorable terms.
</p>
<h2 id="repentance-leading-to-death">
    REPENTANCE LEADING TO DEATH
</h2>
<p>
    False repentance leads to death. It makes people commit one  sin to cover up
    another. Instead of that open-hearted breaking forth of  humility and
    honesty, you see a half-hearted confession that confesses nothing.
</p>
<p>
    Are you ashamed to talk about your sins? If so, then your  sorrow is only
    worldly sorrow. Often sinners avoid conversation about their  sins yet call
    themselves anxious seekers, expecting to become Christians. The  same kind
    of sorrow is found in hell. No doubt all those wretched inhabitants  of the
    pit wish to get away from God's sight. No such sorrow is found among the
    saints in heaven.
</p>
<p>
    Open, genuine sorrow is consistent with true happiness. The  saints are
    happy, yet have a deep, undisguised remorse for sin. But this  worldly
    sorrow is ashamed of itself and is mean and miserable—its end is death.
</p>
<p>
    The change produced by worldly sorrow extends only to those  things about
    which the person has been strongly convicted. The heart is not  changed. You
    will see them avoid only those obvious sins about which they have  been
    counseled.
</p>
<p>
    Watch a young convert. If they're deceived, you will find  only a partial
    change in their conduct. They're reformed in certain things, but  they
    continue to practice many wrong things. If you become closely acquainted
    with them, you will find them strict and sharp-eyed about certain things but
    far from showing a Christian spirit toward all sin.
</p>
<p>
    Usually, the change produced by false repentance is  temporary even in those
    things which are reformed. The person is continually  falling back into old
    sins. The desire to sin is not gone—only checked and  restrained by fear. As
    soon as they have hope, are attending church, and get  built up so that
    their fears are relieved, you will see them gradually  returning to their
    old sins.
</p>
<p>
    This was the difficulty with the house of Israel that made  them constantly
    return to idolatry and other sins. They had only worldly  sorrow. You see it
    everywhere in the Church. People are reformed for a time and  are brought
    into a congregation, but then they fall back into their old sins.  They call
    it "getting cold" or backsliding, but the truth is, they  always loved sin.
</p>
<p>
    This is the foundation of all those flashes and starts in  religion that you
    see so much of. People are awakened and convicted, but soon  they settle
    down in false security and away they go. Perhaps they may keep  their guard
    up and won't be kicked out of church, but if the foundations of sin  are not
    broken up, they will return to their old ways.
</p>
<p>
    A true convert's most obsessive sins before conversion are  the furthest
    from them now. They're least likely to fall into their old  besetting sin
    because they hate it most. But if they're deceived and worldly  minded, they
    always tend toward the same sins. The fountain of sin is not  broken up.
    They have not purged wickedness from their heart but have harbored  sin in
    their heart the whole time.
</p>
<h2 id="bondage-and-legalism">
    BONDAGE AND LEGALISM
</h2>
<p>
    The change produced by false repentance is not only partial  and temporary,
    it's also forced and constrained. The reformation of someone who  has true
    repentance is from the heart. In them the Bible promise is fulfilled.  They
    actually find that wisdom's " ways are pleasant ways, and all her paths  are
    peace" (Proverbs 3:17). They experience that the Savior's yoke is easy  and
    His burden is light. They have felt that God's commandments are not
    burdensome but joyful. "They are more precious than gold, than much pure
    gold; they are sweeter than honey, than honey from the honeycomb" (Psalm
    19:10).
</p>
<p>
    But this fake kind of repentance is very different: it's a  legalistic
    repentance, resulting from fear and not love. Selfish repentance is
    anything but a free, voluntary change from sin to obedience. If you have
    this  kind of repentance, you will find that you're conscious that you
    abstain from  sin not because you hate it but for other reasons. You're more
    motivated by the  warnings of conscience or the fear that you will lose your
    soul, your hope, or  your reputation than from hatred of sin or love of God.
</p>
<p>
    Such people always make excuses for sin, avoid duty, and  think there's no
    great harm in doing as they do. They love their sins. If there  isn't some
    scriptural command from God that they dare not resist, they will  continue
    in sin.
</p>
<p>
    This is not so with true repentance. If something seems  contrary to the
    great law of love, the person who has true repentance will hate  it and
    avoid it whether they have a direct command from God for it or not. They
    see it's contrary to the law of goodness, and they would no more do it than
    they would blaspheme God, steal, or commit any other terrible sin. The
    person  who has true repentance doesn't need a "thus says the Lord" to keep
    them from oppressing their fellow human beings.
</p>
<p>
    False repentance leads to self-righteousness. A person may  know that Jesus
    Christ is the only Savior of sinners and may claim to believe  in and rely
    on Him alone for salvation. But they're actually placing ten times  more
    reliance on their reformation than on Jesus Christ for their salvation.  And
    if they would watch their own heart, they would know it. They may say they
    expect salvation through Christ, but they're really building their own
    righteousness.
</p>
<p>
    They assume their worldly sorrow to be true repentance, and  they trust in
    it. They take it for granted that Jesus will save them because  they have
    had sorrow about their sins, although they're not conscious that they  have
    never felt any resting in Christ. They felt sorrow, then got relief and
    felt better. Now they expect to be saved by Christ, when their very
    consciousness will teach them that they have never relied on Him.
</p>
<p>
    The person who has this kind of sorrow becomes harder in  heart in
    proportion to the number of times they exercise such sorrow. If they  have
    strong emotions of conviction but their heart is not broken, the springs  of
    feeling dry up and their heart becomes more difficult to reach.
</p>
<p>
    A real Christian who has truly repented is different. Every  time you bring
    the truth to them, they become more easily affected, excited,  and broken
    under God's blessed Word. Their heart gets into the habit of going  along
    with the convictions of their understanding, and they become as teachable
    as a little child.
</p>
<h2 id="hardening-of-heart">
    A HARDENING OF HEART
</h2>
<p>
    Churches—or individual members—who have only worldly  repentance pass
    through a revival, get stirred up, and then grow cold again.  Let this be
    repeated, and you will find them more and more difficult to be  roused. Soon
    they become as hard as stone, and nothing can ever rally them to a  revival
    again.
</p>
<p>
    On the other hand, some churches and individuals experience  true
    repentance. Let them go through successive revivals, and you will find  them
    growing more and more tender. When they hear the trumpet blow for a
    revival, they will respond instantly and be ready for the work.
</p>
<p>
    The distinction between true and false repentance is as  broad as between
    light and darkness. The principle is illustrated in sinners  who, after
    passing through repeated revivals, will scoff and criticize.  Although the
    heavens hang with clouds of mercy over their heads, they reject  it. If they
    don't have true repentance, every fresh excitement hardens the  heart and
    makes them more difficult to be reached by the truth.
</p>
<p>
    Some people are thrown into distress whenever the truth is  flashed upon
    their minds. They may not have as much conviction as the real  Christian,
    but the real Christian is filled with peace at the very time their  tears
    are flowing from conviction of sin. And each repeated season of  conviction
    makes them more and more watchful, tender, and careful, until their
    conscience becomes so sensitive that the very appearance of evil will offend
    it. But the other kind of sorrow, which does not lead to true rejection of
    sin,  leaves the heart harder than before and soon sears the conscience like
    a hot  iron.
</p>
<p>
    False repentance is sure to be regretted. You will soon find  these people
    becoming ashamed of the deep feelings that they had. They don't  want to
    speak of them, and if they do talk of them, it's always lightly and  coldly.
    Perhaps they bustled about during the time of revival and appeared as  busy
    as anybody. Very likely they were among the extremes in everything that  was
    done. But now the revival is over, and you find them opposed to new
    measures, changing back, and ashamed of their zeal. In fact, they regret
    their  repentance!
</p>
<p>
    After they have joined a church, they will be ashamed of  their public
    repentance. When the height of the revival has passed, they will  begin to
    talk about being "too enthusiastic" and the necessity of  being more sober
    and consistent.
</p>
<p>
    You sometimes find people who claim to be converted in a  revival turning
    against the very measures, means, and doctrines by which they  claim to have
    been converted. Not so with the true Christian. They're never  ashamed of
    their repentance. The last thing they would ever think of being  ashamed of
    is the excitement they felt in a revival.
</p>
<p>
    Many people have mistaken conviction for conversion and the  sorrow of the
    world for that godly sorrow that "brings repentance that  leads to salvation
    and leaves no regret." I am convinced, after years of  observation, that
    this is the reason for the present deplorable state of the  Church all over
    the world.
</p>
<h2 id="where-do-we-stand">
    WHERE DO WE STAND?
</h2>
<p>
    Many sinners think it's a great trial to give up their  ungodly companions
    and their sins. If they had true repentance, they wouldn't  think it any
    burden to give up their sins. When I first saw young people  becoming
    Christians and joining the Church, I thought it was a good thing  because
    their souls would be saved and they would get to heaven. But at the  time,
    repentance seemed to be a very sorrowful thing. I never dreamed then that
    these young people could ever be truly happy.
</p>
<p>
    It's very common for people who know that Christianity is  good to think
    they can't be happy in the Church. They don't understand that  true
    repentance leads to hatred of those things that were formerly loved.
    Sinners don't see that when their young friends become true Christians,
    sinful  amusements are crucified.
</p>
<p>
    People who experience false repentance don't know what it is  to enjoy
    Christianity. They're not cheerful and happy. They're grieved because  they
    have to withdraw from so many things they love or because they have to  give
    so much money. They're in the fire all the time. Instead of rejoicing in
    every opportunity of self-denial and rejoicing in truth, the plain truth
    distresses them. Why? Because their hearts don't love to work for God. If
    they  loved to do their duty, every ray of light that broke in upon their
    minds from  heaven would be welcomed and would make them happier.
</p>
<p>
    Perhaps you think I suppose all true Christians are perfect.  There is a
    radical difference between a backslidden Christian and a hypocrite  who has
    returned to the world. The hypocrite loves the world and enjoys sin  when
    they return to it. They may have fear, remorse, and worry about the loss  of
    reputation, but after all, they enjoy sin.
</p>
<p>
    The backslidden Christian is different. They lose their  first love, then
    they fall prey to temptation and enter into sin. But they  don't love it.
    It's always bitter to them, and they feel unhappy and homesick.  They have,
    at the time, no Spirit of God to keep them from sin, but they don't  love
    it. They're unhappy, and they feel like a wretch. They're as different  from
    the hypocrite as can be. They can never again enjoy sin or delight in the
    pleasures of the world. Never again can they drink wickedness like water. As
    long as they continue to wander, they're miserable.
</p>
<p>
    Convicted sinners are afraid to pledge themselves to give up  their sins.
    They tell you they can't promise to do it because they're afraid  they won't
    keep the promise. They love sin. The drunk knows that they love  strong
    drink. Although they may be forced to abstain from it, they still crave  it.
    Likewise, the convicted sinner loves sin, and their hold on sin has never
    been broken—they dare not promise to give it up.
</p>
<p>
    Sinners who have worldly sorrow can now see where the  difficulty lies and
    why they are not converted. Their intellectual views of sin  may be such
    that if their hearts corresponded, they would be Christians.  Perhaps they
    think this is true repentance. If they were truly willing to give  up all
    sin, they would not hesitate to pledge themselves to it and have all the
    world know that they had done it.
</p>
<p>
    If you are willing to give up sin, you are willing to  promise to do it and
    willing to have it known that you have done it. But if you  resist
    conviction and still love your sins, all your convictions will not help
    you. They will only sink you deeper in hell for resisting them.
</p>
<p>
    Let us pray that this is the evidence that our repentance is  genuine: "See
    what this godly sorrow has produced in you: what  earnestness, what
    eagerness to clear yourselves, what indignation, what alarm,  what longing,
    what concern, what readiness to see justice done. At every point  you have
    proved yourselves to be innocent in this matter" (2 Corinthians  7:11).
</p>
