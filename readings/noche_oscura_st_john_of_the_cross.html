<h1>
    Noche oscura (The Dark Night)
</h1>
<p>
    <em>St. John of the Cross (1542-1591)</em>
</p>

<p>
One dark night,<br />
fired with love's urgent longings<br />
- ah, the sheer grace! –<br />
I went out unseen,<br />
my house being now all stilled.
</p>

<p>
In darkness, and secure,<br />
by the secret ladder, disguised,<br />
- ah, the sheer grace! –<br />
in darkness and concealment,<br />
my house being now all stilled.
</p>

<p>
On that glad night,<br />
in secret, for no one saw me,<br />
nor did I look at anything,<br />
with no other light or guide<br />
than the one that burned in my heart.
</p>

<p>
This guided me<br />
more surely than the light of noon<br />
to where he was awaiting me<br />
- him I knew so well –<br />
there in a place where no one appeared.
</p>

<p>
O guiding night!<br />
O night more lovely than the dawn!<br />
O night that has united<br />
the Lover with his beloved,<br />
transforming the beloved in her Lover.
</p>

<p>
Upon my flowering breast<br />
which I kept wholly for him alone,<br />
there he lay sleeping,<br />
and I caressing him<br />
there in a breeze from the fanning cedars.
</p>

<p>
When the breeze blew from the turret,<br />
as I parted his hair,<br />
it wounded my neck<br />
with its gentle hand,<br />
suspending all my senses.
</p>

<p>
I abandoned and forgot myself,<br />
laying my face on my Beloved;<br />
all things ceased; I went out from myself,<br />
leaving my cares<br />
forgotten among the lilies.
