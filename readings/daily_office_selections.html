    <strong>Opening Verse</strong>
</p>

<p>
    "Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ." <em>Philippians 1:2</em>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Confession of Sin</strong>
</p>

<p>
    Almighty and most merciful Father,<br>
    we have erred and strayed from your ways like lost sheep.<br>
    We have followed too much the devices and desires of our own hearts.<br>
    We have offended against your holy laws.<br>
    We have left undone those things which we ought to have done,<br>
    and we have done those things which we ought not to have done;<br>
    And apart from your grace, there is no health in us.
</p>

<p>
    O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br>
    Spare all those who confess their faults.<br>
    Restore all those who are penitent,<br>
    according to your promises declared to all people in Christ Jesus our Lord.<br>
    And grant, O most merciful Father, for his sake,<br>
    that we may now live a godly, righteous, and sober life,<br>
    to the glory of your holy Name.
</p>

<p>
    <em>Amen.</em>
</p>

<p>
    Grant to your faithful people, merciful Lord, pardon and peace; that we may be cleansed from all our sins, and serve you with a quiet mind; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
</p>

<p>
    <em>Amen.</em>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Invitatory</strong>
</p>

<p>
    O Lord, open our lips;<br>
    And our mouth shall proclaim your praise.<br>
    O God, make speed to save us;<br>
    O Lord, make haste to help us.<br>
    Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit;<br>
    as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end.
</p>

<p>
    <em>Amen.</em>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>O Come (<em>Venite</em>) – Psalm 95:1–7</strong>
</p>

<p>
    O come, let us sing unto the Lord;<br>
    let us heartily rejoice in the strength of our salvation.<br>
    Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving<br>
    and show ourselves glad in him with psalms.<br>
    For the Lord is a great God<br>
    and a great King above all gods.<br>
    In his hand are all the depths of the earth<br>
    and the heights of the hills are his also.<br>
    The sea is his, for he made it,<br>
    and his hands prepared the dry land.<br>
    O come, let us worship and fall down,<br>
    and kneel before the Lord our Maker.<br>
    For he is our God,<br>
    and we are the people of his pasture,<br>
    and the sheep of his hand.

</p>

<p>
    We praise you, O God; we acclaim you as Lord;<br>
    all creation worships you, the Father everlasting.<br>
    To you all angels, all the powers of heaven,<br>
    the cherubim and seraphim, sing in endless praise:<br>
    Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of power and might,<br>
    heaven and earth are full of your glory.<br>
    The glorious company of apostles praise you.<br>
    The noble fellowship of prophets praise you.<br>
    The white-robed army of martyrs praise you.<br>
    Throughout the world the holy Church acclaims you:<br>
    Father, of majesty unbounded,<br>
    your true and only Son, worthy of all praise,<br>
    and the Holy Spirit, advocate and guide.<br>
    You, Christ, are the king of glory,<br>
    the eternal Son of the Father.<br>
    When you took our flesh to set us free<br>
    you humbly chose the Virgin's womb.<br>
    You overcame the sting of death<br>
    and opened the kingdom of heaven to all believers.<br>
    You are seated at God's right hand in glory.<br>
    We believe that you will come to be our judge.<br>
    Come then, Lord, and help your people,<br>
    bought with the price of your own blood,<br>
    and bring us with your saints<br>
    to glory everlasting.

    <strong>The Song of Mary (<em>Magnificat</em>) – Lk. 1:46–55</strong>

<p>
    My soul magnifies the Lord,<br>
    and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior;<br>
    For he has regarded<br>
    the lowliness of his handmaiden.<br>
    For behold, from now on,<br>

    For he that is mighty has magnified me,<br>
    and holy is his Name.<br>
    And his mercy is on those who fear him,<br>
    throughout all generations.<br>
    He has shown the strength of his arm;<br>
    he has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.<br>
    He has brought down the mighty from their thrones,<br>
    and has exalted the humble and meek.<br>
    He has filled the hungry with good things,<br>
    and the rich he has sent empty away.<br>
    He, remembering his mercy, has helped his servant Israel,<br>
    as he promised to our fathers, Abraham and his seed for ever.

    O come, let us sing unto the Lord;<br>
    let us heartily rejoice in the strength of our salvation.<br>
    Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving<br>
    and show ourselves glad in him with psalms.<br>
    For the Lord is a great God<br>
    and a great King above all gods.<br>
    In his hand are all the depths of the earth<br>
    and the heights of the hills are his also.<br>
    The sea is his, for he made it,<br>
    and his hands prepared the dry land.<br>
    O come, let us worship and fall down,<br>
    and kneel before the Lord our Maker.<br>
    For he is our God,<br>
    and we are the people of his pasture,<br>
    and the sheep of his hand.

    You are seated at God's right hand in glory.<br>

<p>
    My soul magnifies the Lord,<br>
    and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior;<br>
    For he has regarded<br>
    the lowliness of his handmaiden.<br>
    For behold, from now on,<br>
    all generations will call me blessed;<br>
    For he that is mighty has magnified me,<br>
    and holy is his Name.<br>
    And his mercy is on those who fear him,<br>
    throughout all generations.<br>
    He has shown the strength of his arm;<br>
    he has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.<br>
    He has brought down the mighty from their thrones,<br>
    and has exalted the humble and meek.<br>
    He has filled the hungry with good things,<br>
    and the rich he has sent empty away.<br>
    He, remembering his mercy, has helped his servant Israel,<br>
    as he promised to our fathers, Abraham and his seed for ever.

<p>
    My soul magnifies the Lord,<br>
    and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior;<br>
    For he has regarded<br>
    the lowliness of his handmaiden.<br>
    For behold, from now on,<br>
    all generations will call me blessed;<br>
    For he that is mighty has magnified me,<br>
    and holy is his Name.<br>
    And his mercy is on those who fear him,<br>
    throughout all generations.<br>
    He has shown the strength of his arm;<br>
    he has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.<br>
    He has brought down the mighty from their thrones,<br>
    and has exalted the humble and meek.<br>
    He has filled the hungry with good things,<br>
    and the rich he has sent empty away.<br>
    He, remembering his mercy, has helped his servant Israel,<br>
    as he promised to our fathers, Abraham and his seed for ever.

</p>

<p>
    My soul magnifies the Lord,<br>
    and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior;<br>
    For he has regarded<br>
    the lowliness of his handmaiden.<br>
    For behold, from now on,<br>
    all generations will call me blessed;<br>
    For he that is mighty has magnified me,<br>
    and holy is his Name.<br>
    And his mercy is on those who fear him,<br>
    throughout all generations.<br>
    He has shown the strength of his arm;<br>
    he has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.<br>
    He has brought down the mighty from their thrones,<br>
    and has exalted the humble and meek.<br>
    He has filled the hungry with good things,<br>
    and the rich he has sent empty away.<br>
    He, remembering his mercy, has helped his servant Israel,<br>
    as he promised to our fathers, Abraham and his seed for ever.

    <strong>A Prayer of St. John Chrysostom</strong>
</p>

<p>
    Almighty God, you have given us grace at this time, with one accord to make our common supplications to you; and you have promised through your well-beloved Son that when two or three are gathered together in his Name you will grant their requests. Fulfill now, O Lord, our desires and petitions as may be best for us; granting us in this world knowledge of your truth, and in the age to come life everlasting.
</p>

<p>
    <em>Amen.</em>
</p>

    <strong>Meditate on a Verse</strong>

    "Lord, I have loved the habitation of your house and the place where your honor dwells." <em><em>Psalm 26:8</em></em>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Confession of Sins</strong>
</p>

<p>
    Almighty and most merciful Father,<br>
    we have erred and strayed from your ways like lost sheep.<br>
    We have followed too much the devices and desires of our own hearts.<br>
    We have offended against your holy laws.<br>
    We have left undone those things which we ought to have done,<br>
    and we have done those things which we ought not to have done;<br>
    And apart from your grace, there is no health in us.
</p>

<p>
    O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br>
    Spare all those who confess their faults.<br>
    Restore all those who are penitent,<br>
    according to your promises declared to all people in Christ Jesus our Lord.<br>
    And grant, O most merciful Father, for his sake,<br>
    that we may now live a godly, righteous, and sober life,<br>
    to the glory of your holy Name.
</p>

<p>
    <em>Amen.</em>
</p>

<p>
    Grant to your faithful people, merciful Lord, pardon and peace; that we may be cleansed from all our sins, and serve you with a quiet mind; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
</p>

<p>
    <em>Amen.</em>
</p>

    <strong>The Invitatory</strong>
</p>

<p>
    O Lord, open our lips;<br>
    And our mouth shall proclaim your praise.<br>
    O God, make speed to save us;<br>
    O Lord, make haste to help us.<br>
    Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit;<br>
    as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end.

    <em>Amen.</em>

    <strong>O Gladsome Light (<em>Phos Hilaron</em>)</strong>
</p>

<p>
    O gladsome light,<br>
    pure brightness of the everliving Father in heaven,<br>
    O Jesus Christ, holy and blessed!<br>
    Now as we come to the setting of the sun,<br>
    and our eyes behold the vesper light,<br>
    we sing your praises, O God: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.<br>
    You are worthy at all times to be praised by happy voices,<br>
    O Son of God, O Giver of Life,<br>
    and to be glorified through all the worlds.

    <strong>Canticle</strong>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>The Song of Mary (<em>Magnificat</em>) – Lk. 1:46–55</strong>
</p>

<p>
    My soul magnifies the Lord,<br>
    and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior;<br>
    For he has regarded<br>
    the lowliness of his handmaiden.<br>
    For behold, from now on,<br>
    all generations will call me blessed;<br>
    For he that is mighty has magnified me,<br>
    and holy is his Name.<br>
    And his mercy is on those who fear him,<br>
    throughout all generations.<br>
    He has shown the strength of his arm;<br>
    he has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.<br>
    He has brought down the mighty from their thrones,<br>
    and has exalted the humble and meek.<br>
    He has filled the hungry with good things,<br>
    and the rich he has sent empty away.<br>
    He, remembering his mercy, has helped his servant Israel,<br>
    as he promised to our fathers, Abraham and his seed for ever.
</p>

<p>
    Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit;<br>
    as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end.
</p>

<p>
    <em>Amen.</em>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>The Apostles' Creed</strong>
</p>

<p>
    I believe in God, the Father almighty,<br>
    creator of heaven and earth.
</p>

<p>
    I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord.<br>
    He was conceived by the Holy Spirit<br>
    and born of the Virgin Mary.<br>
    He suffered under Pontius Pilate,<br>
    was crucified, died, and was buried.<br>
    He descended to the dead.<br>
    On the third day he rose again.<br>
    He ascended into heaven,<br>
    and is seated at the right hand of the Father.<br>
    He will come again to judge the living and the dead.
</p>

<p>
    I believe in the Holy Spirit,<br>
    the holy catholic Church,<br>
    the communion of saints,<br>
    the forgiveness of sins,<br>
    the resurrection of the body,<br>
    and the life everlasting.
</p>

    <em>Amen.</em>

    <strong>The Lord's Prayer</strong>

<p>
    Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your Name.<br>
    Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.<br>
    Give us today our daily bread.<br>
    And forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who sin against us.<br>
    Save us from the time of trial, and deliver us from evil.<br>
    For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours, now and for ever.

    <em>Amen.</em>

    O Lord, show your mercy upon us;<br>

    Give peace in our time, O Lord;<br>

</p>

<p>
    Create in us clean hearts, O God;<br>
    And take not your Holy Spirit from us.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Today's Collect</strong>
</p>

<p>
    Grant us, Lord, not to be anxious about earthly things, but to love things heavenly; and even now, as we live among things that are passing away, to hold fast to those that shall endure; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.

</p>

<p>
    <em>Amen.</em>
</p>
