    PROLOGUE
</h2>
<p>
    Listen carefully in your heart, my son, and pay close attention to your
    master's teachings. Accept with a willing mind and actively follow your
    holy father's guidance, so that through the hard work of obedience you
    may return to Him from whom you had withdrawn through the laziness of
    disobedience. I now speak these words of encouragement to you, whoever
    you are, who are giving up your own will and taking up the powerful and
    victorious weapons of obedience to serve your true king, Christ the
    Lord.
</p>
<p>
    First, whenever you begin any good work, pray earnestly that He will
    bring it to completion, so that He who already considers us among His
    children will never be grieved by our evil actions. We owe Him such
    obedience at all times because of the good things He does in us, so that
    He will never, like an angry father, disinherit us as His children, or
    like a fearsome master angered by our wrongdoing, hand us over to
    eternal punishment as wicked servants who refused to follow Him to
    glory.
</p>
<p>
    Let us therefore finally rise up, as Scripture urges us: "Now is the
    time for us to wake up from sleep." With our eyes open to God's light,
    let us listen with amazed ears to God's voice crying out to us daily:
    "Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts." And again:
    "Let anyone who has ears to hear listen to what the Spirit says to the
    churches." And what does the Spirit say? "Come, children, listen to
    me: I will teach you the fear of the Lord. Run while you have the light
    of life, so that the darkness of death does not overtake you."
</p>
<p>
    Looking for His worker among the crowd of people to whom He proclaims
    these things, the Lord says again: "Who is the person who wants life
    and desires to see good days?" If you hear this and answer "I do,"
    God then says to you: "If you want true and eternal life, keep your
    tongue from evil and do not let your lips speak deceit. Turn away from
    evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it. When you have done this, My
    eyes will be on you and My ears will be open to your prayers. Before you
    call out, I will say, 'Here I am.'"
</p>
<p>
    What could be sweeter to us, dear brothers, than this voice of the Lord
    inviting us? See how the Lord lovingly shows us the way of life through
    His fatherly care.
</p>
<p>
    Let us prepare ourselves with faith and good works, and following the
    Gospel, let us walk in His paths so that we may be worthy to see Him who
    has called us to His kingdom. But if we want to live in His kingdom, we
    must remember that we can only reach it by running there through good
    deeds.
</p>
<p>
    Let us ask the Lord with the prophet: "Lord, who may live in Your
    sanctuary? Who may dwell on Your holy mountain?" After asking this
    question, brothers, let us listen to the Lord showing us the way to that
    sanctuary: "The one who lives with integrity and does what is right;
    who speaks truth from their heart; who does not slander with their
    tongue; who does no wrong to a neighbor and casts no slur on others."
    This is the person who has defeated the devil, the evil slanderer, by
    rejecting him and his tempting thoughts from their heart, and who has
    taken hold of these temptations while they were still weak and smashed
    them against Christ, who is the Rock.
</p>
<p>
    Those who fear the Lord do not become proud of their good behavior, but
    recognize that the good in them comes not from themselves but from God.
    They praise the Lord working in them and say with the prophet: "Not to
    us, Lord, not to us, but to Your name give glory." Just as the apostle
    Paul took no credit for his preaching, saying: "By the grace of God I
    am what I am." And again Paul said: "Let the one who boasts, boast in
    the Lord."
</p>
<p>
    Therefore, the Lord also says in the Gospel: "Everyone who hears these
    words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built
    his house on the rock. The rain came down, the streams rose, and the
    winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it
    had its foundation on the rock."
</p>
<p>
    Because of this, our Lord daily expects us to respond to His holy
    teachings with our actions. The days of this life are extended for us as
    a kind of truce to correct our faults, as the apostle says: "Don't you
    realize that God's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance?" For
    the Lord in His kindness says: "I take no pleasure in the death of the
    wicked, but rather that they turn from their ways and live."
</p>
<p>
    Since we have asked the Lord about who may dwell in His sanctuary, we
    have heard the requirements for living there. Therefore, our hearts and
    bodies must be prepared to serve like soldiers under holy obedience to
    these commands. Whatever our human nature cannot accomplish, let us ask
    the Lord to supply through His grace. And if we wish to escape the pains
    of hell and reach eternal life, we must hurry to do only those things
    that will benefit us for eternity, while we still have time and are in
    this body and have the opportunity to fulfill all these commands in this
    life.
</p>
<p>
    We must therefore establish a school for the Lord's service. In setting
    this up, we hope to establish nothing harsh or burdensome. But if
    anything is set down somewhat strictly for correcting faults or
    preserving love, do not immediately run away in fear from the path of
    salvation, which can only begin through a narrow entrance. For as we
    progress in the life of faith and conversion, our hearts expand, and we
    run the way of God's commandments with unspeakable sweetness of love.
    By never leaving His teaching but persevering in His instruction in the
    monastery until death, we may through patience share in the sufferings
    of Christ and deserve to be heirs of His kingdom. Amen.
</p>
<h2 id="chapter-5">
    CHAPTER 5: CONCERNING OBEDIENCE
</h2>
<p>
    The first level of humility is immediate obedience. This is fitting for
    those who consider nothing more precious than Christ, because of the
    holy commitment they have made, whether from fear of hell or desire for
    eternal life. As soon as any command is given by a superior, as if it
    were given by God Himself, they cannot tolerate any delay in carrying it
    out. The Lord speaks of these people: "As soon as they heard, they
    obeyed me." And again He says to teachers: "Whoever listens to you
    listens to me."
</p>
<p>
    Therefore, such people immediately abandon what they are doing and give
    up their own will. They quickly drop what they were working on, leaving
    it unfinished, and with ready obedience hurry to carry out the command
    given. It is as if, for those who love to attain eternal life, both the
    master's command and the disciple's completed work happen almost
    simultaneously, with great speed due to their reverent fear of God. This
    is how they take the narrow path of which the Lord says: "Narrow is the
    road that leads to life." By not living according to their own judgment
    and not obeying their own desires and wishes, but living according to
    another's judgment and commands, they live in community and are happy
    to have an abbot over them. Without doubt, such people follow the
    Lord's saying: "I have come not to do my will but the will of him who
    sent me."
</p>
<p>
    But this obedience will only be acceptable to God and pleasing to people
    when what is commanded is carried out without fear, delay, lukewarmness,
    grumbling, or unwilling back-talk. Obedience given to superiors is an
    offering made to God, because He said: "Whoever listens to you listens
    to me." Disciples should give obedience willingly, because God loves a
    cheerful giver. If a disciple obeys unwillingly, even if they grumble
    only in their heart and not out loud, though they fulfill the command,
    they will not be accepted by God as obedient, because He sees the heart
    of the grumbler. For such behavior they earn no reward, but rather incur
    the penalty for grumbling, unless they change and make amends.
</p>
<h2 id="chapter-6">
    CHAPTER 6: CONCERNING SILENCE
</h2>
<p>
    Let us do what the prophet says: "I said, 'I will watch my ways and
    keep my tongue from sin; I will put a muzzle on my mouth while in the
    presence of the wicked.' I remained utterly silent, not even saying
    anything good." Here the prophet shows that if we should sometimes
    refrain from speaking good words for the sake of silence, how much more
    should we avoid evil words because of the punishment for sin.
</p>
<p>
    Therefore, even though it concerns good and holy conversation that
    builds others up, let fully trained disciples rarely be given permission
    to speak, because of the importance of silence. For it is written: " In
    the multitude of words sin is not lacking," and elsewhere: "The tongue
    has the power of life and death." Speaking and teaching is the
    master's role; being silent and listening is the disciple's role. So,
    if anything needs to be asked of the superior, let it be asked with all
    humility and respectful submission.
</p>
<p>
    We judge that all foolishness, idle words, and things said just to
    provoke laughter should be permanently banned everywhere, and we do not
    permit the disciple to open their mouth for such talk.
</p>
<h2 id="chapter-7">
    CHAPTER 7: CONCERNING HUMILITY
</h2>
<p>
    Brothers, the holy Scriptures call out to us: "All who exalt themselves
    will be humbled, and all who humble themselves will be exalted."
</p>
<p>
    In saying this, Scripture reveals that all self-exaltation is pride,
    which the prophet shows he guards against by saying: "Lord, my heart is
    not proud, nor my eyes haughty; I do not concern myself with great
    matters or things too wonderful for me." But why? "Instead, I have
    kept myself humble and not proud; like a weaned child resting peacefully
    with its mother, my soul is at peace with You." Therefore, brothers, if
    we wish to reach the highest point of humility and quickly arrive at
    that heavenly exaltation which is reached through humility in this
    present life, we must set up by our actions the ladder that appeared in
    Jacob's dream, on which angels were shown ascending and descending. We
    understand this ascending and descending to mean descending by pride and
    ascending by humility.
</p>
<p>
    That ladder represents our life in this world, which the Lord raises up
    to heaven when our heart is humbled. We say that the sides of this
    ladder are our body and soul, and into these sides God has inserted
    various rungs of humility and discipline by which we may climb.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The first step of humility</strong> is to keep the fear of God always
    before our eyes and never forget it, always remembering everything God
    has commanded and always thinking about eternal life, which is prepared
    for those who fear God, and how hell will destroy those who despise God
    because of their sins. We must keep ourselves at all times from sins and
    faults of thought, tongue, eyes, hands, feet, and self-will, and also
    hurry to cut away the desires of the flesh.
</p>
<p>
    Let a person always consider that they are being watched by God from
    heaven and that whatever they do anywhere is seen by God's watchful eye
    and is always reported to God by the angels. The prophet makes this
    clear when he shows God always present in our thoughts, saying: "God
    searches hearts and minds." And again: "The Lord knows human
    thoughts." And again: "You discern my going out and my lying down; you
    are familiar with all my ways." And: "Even before a word is on my
    tongue you, Lord, know it completely." So that he may be careful about
    wrong thoughts, let the humble brother always say in his heart: "I will
    be blameless in His sight if I keep myself from my sin."
</p>
<p>
    But we are forbidden to do our own will, as Scripture says: "Turn away
    from your selfish desires." And again, in prayer we ask God that His
    will be done in us. We are therefore rightly taught not to do our own
    will when we heed what Scripture says: "There are ways that appear
    right to a person, but in the end they lead to death." And again, we
    should fear what is said about the careless: "They are corrupt and have
    become vile in their ways."
</p>
<p>
    Regarding the desires of the flesh, let us believe that God is always
    present with us, as the prophet says to the Lord: "All my longings lie
    open before you, Lord." We must therefore beware of evil desires,
    because death lies close to the entrance of pleasure. So, Scripture
    commands: "Do not follow your evil desires." Therefore, since the eyes
    of the Lord watch over the righteous and the wicked, and the Lord always
    looks down from heaven on all people to see if there are any who
    understand, any who seek God; and since the angels assigned to us report
    our works to the Lord every day and night, we must always be careful,
    brothers, as the prophet says in the psalm, that God never sees us
    "become corrupt and turn aside into evil," and that although He spares
    us now because He lovingly waits for us to change for the better, He
    will never say to us in the future: "These things you did and I kept
    silent."
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The second step of humility</strong> is when someone does not love their
    own will and does not delight in satisfying their desires, but imitates
    in their actions the Lord's words: "I have come not to do my will but
    the will of him who sent me." Scripture also says: "Self-will brings
    punishment, but necessity earns a crown."
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The third step of humility</strong> is when a person submits to their
    superior in all obedience for the love of God, imitating the Lord, of
    whom the apostle says: "He became obedient to death."
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The fourth step of humility</strong> is when in this same obedience, even
    if hard and contrary things and even injuries of any kind are inflicted,
    he embraces them patiently with a quiet conscience and does not grow
    weary or give up, as Scripture says: "The one who stands firm to the
    end will be saved." And again: "Be strong and take heart and wait for
    the Lord." And showing that the faithful person should patiently endure
    all things for the Lord's sake, no matter how contrary, Scripture says
    in the voice of the suffering: "For your sake we face death all day
    long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered." And secure in
    their hope of God's reward, they continue joyfully saying: "But in all
    these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us."
</p>
<p>
    And again elsewhere Scripture says: "You, God, tested us; you refined
    us like silver. You brought us into prison and laid burdens on our
    backs." And to show that we ought to be under a superior, it continues:
    "You let people ride over our heads." Moreover, fulfilling the Lord's
    command with patience in adversities and injuries, when struck on one
    cheek they offer the other; when someone takes their coat, they give
    their shirt as well; when forced to go one mile, they go two; with Paul
    the apostle they put up with false believers and bless those who curse
    them.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The fifth step of humility</strong> is when a monk does not hide from his
    abbot any sinful thoughts entering his heart or any wrongs committed in
    secret, but humbly confesses them. Scripture encourages this, saying:
    "Commit your way to the Lord; trust in him." And again: "Confess to
    the Lord, for he is good; his love endures forever." And the prophet
    says: "Then I acknowledged my sin to you and did not cover up my
    iniquity. I said, 'I will confess my transgressions to the Lord.' And
    you forgave the guilt of my sin."
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The sixth step of humility</strong> is when a monk is content with the
    lowest and most menial treatment, and regards himself as a poor and
    worthless workman at whatever task is given him, saying to himself with
    the prophet: "I was senseless and ignorant; I was a brute beast before
    you. Yet I am always with you."
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The seventh step of humility</strong> is when a man not only admits with
    his tongue that he is inferior and more worthless than others, but also
    believes it in his heart, humbling himself and saying with the prophet:
    "But I am a worm and not a man, scorned by everyone, despised by the
    people. I was exalted, then humbled and overwhelmed with shame." And
    again: "It was good for me to be afflicted so that I might learn your
    decrees."
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The eighth step of humility</strong> is when a monk does nothing except
    what is encouraged by the common rule of the monastery and the example
    of his seniors.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The ninth step of humility</strong> is when a monk controls his tongue
    and remains silent, not speaking unless asked a question, as Scripture
    shows: "Sin is not ended by multiplying words," and "A talkative
    person cannot be guided on earth."
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The tenth step of humility</strong> is when he is not given to ready,
    easy laughter, for it is written: "Only fools raise their voices in
    laughter."
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The eleventh step of humility</strong> is when a monk speaks gently and
    without laughter, seriously and with few words, reasonably, and not with
    a loud voice, as it is written: "The wise are known by their few
    words."
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The twelfth step of humility</strong> is when a monk is not only humble
    in heart, but also shows humility in his posture to all who see him.
    Whether at the Work of God, in the oratory, in the monastery, in the
    garden, on the road, in the field, or anywhere else, whether sitting,
    walking, or standing, his head should always be bowed and his eyes cast
    down. Always considering himself guilty of his sins, he should think of
    himself as already appearing before God's fearful judgment, always
    saying in his heart what the tax collector in the Gospel said with his
    eyes fixed on the ground: "God, have mercy on me, a sinner." And again
    with the prophet: "I am bowed down and brought very low."
</p>
<p>
    Now when a monk has climbed all these steps of humility, he will quickly
    arrive at that perfect love of God which casts out fear. Through this
    love, all that he once performed with dread he will now begin to observe
    without effort, as if naturally, from habit, no longer because of fear
    of hell, but out of love for Christ, good habit, and delight in virtue.
    All this the Lord will by the Holy Spirit graciously manifest in His
    workman now cleansed of vices and sins.
</p>
<h2 id="chapter-16">
    CHAPTER 16: HOW THE WORK OF GOD IS TO BE CARRIED OUT DURING THE DAY
</h2>
<p>
    As the prophet says: "Seven times a day I praise you." We fulfill this
    sacred number seven when we perform our service at Lauds, Prime, Terce,
    Sext, None, Vespers, and Compline. For the prophet said about these
    times: "Seven times a day I praise you." And concerning night prayer,
    the same prophet says: "At midnight I rise to give you thanks."
    Therefore, at these times—Lauds, Prime, Terce, Sext, None, Vespers,
    and Compline—let us offer praise to our Creator for His righteous
    judgments, and let us rise at night to praise Him.
</p>
<h2 id="chapter-19">
    CHAPTER 19: CONCERNING THE DISCIPLINE OF SAYING THE DIVINE OFFICE
</h2>
<p>
    We believe that God is present everywhere and that the eyes of the Lord
    see both the good and the bad wherever they may be. But we should
    believe this especially without any doubt when we participate in the
    Work of God. Therefore, let us always remember what the prophet says:
    "Serve the Lord with fear," and again: "Sing praise with
    understanding," and "In the presence of the angels I will sing to
    you." So let us consider how we ought to behave in the sight of God and
    His angels, and let us participate in the psalms in such a way that our
    minds are in harmony with our voices.
</p>
<h2 id="chapter-35">
    CHAPTER 35: CONCERNING THE WEEKLY KITCHEN WORKERS
</h2>
<p>
    Let the brothers serve in turn, so that no one is excused from kitchen
    duty, except for reasons of illness or if someone is occupied with some
    other matter of special importance; for in this way charity is acquired
    and greater merit gained. But let help be given to the weak, so that
    they may fulfill this duty without sadness; and indeed let all have help
    according to the size of the community and the circumstances of the
    place. If the community is large, let the cellarer be excused from the
    kitchen; and also, as we have said, if there are any others who are
    occupied with important business. But let the rest, in the name of
    charity, take turns in serving.
</p>
<p>
    On Saturday let the one who is about to finish his week of service clean
    up everything. Let him wash the towels with which the brothers dry their
    hands and feet; and let both the one who goes out and the one who is
    about to enter wash the feet of all. Let him return to the cellarer the
    vessels of his service, clean and whole; and let the cellarer give them
    to the one who comes in, so that he may know what he gives and what he
    receives.
</p>
<p>
    And let the weekly kitchen workers each receive, over and above the
    appointed portion, something to drink and bread, one hour before the
    meal, so that they may serve their brothers at mealtime without
    grumbling or great labor. On feast days, however, let them wait until
    after Mass. On Sunday let the incoming and the outgoing weekly officials
    prostrate themselves before all the brothers in the chapel at the end of
    Lauds and ask for prayers for themselves; and let the one going out from
    the week's work say this verse: "Blessed are You, O Lord God, because
    You have helped me and comforted me"; and when this has been said three
    times let the one going out receive his blessing. Then let the one
    coming in follow and say: "O God, make speed to save me; O Lord, make
    haste to help me"; and let this likewise be repeated three times by
    all, and having received the blessing let him enter upon his office.
</p>
<h2 id="chapter-36">
    CHAPTER 36: CONCERNING THE SICK AND INFIRM BROTHERS
</h2>
<p>
    Before all things and above all things care is to be taken of the sick,
    so that they may be served as if they were truly Christ, because He
    Himself said: "I have been sick and you have visited Me"; and: "What
    you have done to one of these My little ones, you have done to Me." But
    at the same time let the sick themselves keep in mind that it is for
    God's honor they are served, and so let them not weary their brothers
    who serve them with unnecessary demands. Yet they must be patiently
    borne with, because from such service more abundant merit is acquired.
    Therefore, let the abbot take very great care that they suffer no
    neglect.
</p>
<p>
    And for these sick brothers let a cell be set apart; and as their
    attendant, one who fears God and is diligent and careful. Let the sick
    be allowed the use of baths as often as is helpful; but to those in good
    health and especially to the young let it be granted less readily.
    Moreover, let the eating of meat be granted to the sick and especially
    to those who are weak, for their recovery; but when they have gotten
    better let them all abstain from meat as usual. And let the abbot take
    the greatest care that the sick are not neglected by the cellarers and
    the attendants; for he is responsible for anything his disciples do
    wrong.
</p>
<h2 id="chapter-42">
    CHAPTER 42: THAT NO ONE TALK AFTER COMPLINE
</h2>
<p>
    Monks ought to be zealous to keep silence at all times, but especially
    through the hours of the night. And so at every season, be it fast or
    non-fast: and when it is not a fast, soon after rising from supper, let
    them all go and sit down together and let one of them read the
    Conferences, or the lives of the fathers, or indeed anything that may be
    edifying to hear, but not the Heptateuch nor the Books of the Kings,
    because it would not be profitable for those of weak intelligence to
    hear this portion of Scripture at that hour of the day, though at other
    hours let them be read.
</p>
<p>
    On fast days, after Vespers, wait briefly, then gather together for the
    reading we mentioned earlier. Read four or five pages, or whatever time
    allows, with everyone coming together in the same place - even those who
    were busy with assigned tasks should join the group. Once everyone is
    present, hold the final night prayer. After Compline ends, no one is
    allowed to speak to anyone else. Anyone who breaks this silence rule
    will face serious punishment, with only two exceptions: when hospitality
    requires speaking to guests, or when the abbot gives someone a direct
    order. Even in these exceptional cases, any talking must be done with
    complete seriousness and restraint.
</p>
<h2 id="chapter-48">
    CHAPTER 48: CONCERNING THE DAILY MANUAL WORK
</h2>
<p>
    Idleness is harmful to the soul; and therefore the brothers ought to be
    occupied, at fixed times, with manual work and again at fixed times with
    spiritual reading. And so we think the hours for each should be arranged
    on this plan: that is to say that from Easter to the first of October
    they go out in the morning from Prime and work at whatever has to be
    done until nearly the fourth hour; and from the fourth hour have time
    for reading until about the sixth hour. And when they rise from table
    after the sixth hour let them rest upon their beds in complete silence;
    or if by chance anyone should wish to read, let him so read that he may
    not disturb anyone else. Let None be said in good time, about the middle
    of the eighth hour, and then again let them work at whatever has to be
    done, until Vespers.
</p>
<p>
    And let them not be distressed if poverty or the needs of the place
    should require that they busy themselves about gathering in the crops
    with their own hands; for then are they truly monks, when they live by
    the work of their own hands, as did our fathers and the apostles. Let
    everything be done in moderation however on account of the fainthearted.
</p>
<p>
    And from the first of October until the beginning of Lent let them have
    reading time until the end of the second hour; and at the second hour
    let Terce be said and then all go to work until None at whatever is
    assigned them. But as soon as the first signal for None is made, let
    each and all break off from their work and be ready by the time the
    second signal has sounded. And after dinner let them have time for their
    studies and for learning the psalms.
</p>
<p>
    But in Lent let them have time for their studies from morning until the
    end of the third hour; and let them go to work at whatever is assigned
    them until the end of the tenth hour. In Lent moreover let them each
    have a book from the library and read it straight through; and these
    books are to be given out at the beginning of Lent. And above all let
    one or two seniors be appointed to go around the monastery and keep
    watch during reading hours lest by chance any brother be found idle, or
    chatting instead of intent upon his reading; and therefore be not only
    useless to himself but also a distraction to others. And if, which be
    far from us, such a one be found, let him be corrected once and yet
    again; and if then he is not amended let him be subjected to correction
    according to rule in such a way that others be put in fear. And let not
    brother associate with brother at times not appointed for that purpose.
</p>
<p>
    Furthermore, on the Lord's day let all have time for reading, except
    those who have been assigned various duties; but if there shall be
    anyone so uninterested or so lazy that through lack of will power or of
    ability he can neither study nor read, let there be some work assigned
    him that he may not be idle. To weak and delicate brothers let there be
    assigned such suitable occupation and duties that they be neither
    overcome by idleness nor so oppressed by exhaustion through work that
    they be driven to flight. Their weakness is to be taken into
    consideration by the abbot.

    CHAPTER 57: CONCERNING CRAFTSMEN IN THE MONASTERY
</h2>
<p>
    Let craftsmen, if there are any in the monastery, work at their trades
    with all humility, if the abbot has given permission. But if any one of
    their number becomes proud because of his knowledge of his trade,
    thinking that he confers some favor upon the monastery, let such a one
    be removed from practicing that trade and not engage in it again unless
    by chance the abbot again orders him to do so when he has become humble.
</p>
<p>
    And if any of the craftsmen's work is to be sold, let those who are to
    handle the transaction see to it that they do not commit any fraudulent
    act. Let them always be mindful of Ananias and Sapphira, lest perhaps
    the death which they incurred in the body they themselves and indeed all
    who commit any fraud regarding monastic property should suffer in the
    soul. And let not the evil of greed creep in regarding the prices
    charged for the goods; but let them always be sold somewhat more cheaply
    than they can be sold by others who are secular, so that in all things
    God may be glorified.

<h2 id="chapter-71">
    CHAPTER 71: THAT THE BROTHERS BE OBEDIENT AMONG THEMSELVES
</h2>
<p>
    The virtue of obedience should not only be shown by all toward the
    abbot, but the brothers should also be obedient to one another, keeping
    in mind that through this path of obedience they are traveling toward
    God. Therefore, after giving priority to any command from the abbot or
    from the deans whom he has appointed—and we do not allow private
    commands to take precedence over these—let all the younger brothers
    obey their seniors with the most careful love. But if anyone is found to
    be argumentative, let him be corrected.
</p>
<p>
    If any brother is corrected in any way by the abbot or by any of his
    seniors, or if he perceives that any senior is angry or upset with him,
    however slightly, let him immediately and without delay prostrate
    himself on the ground and lie at his feet, making satisfaction until
    that hurt feeling is healed by the giving of a blessing. But if anyone
    should refuse to do this, let him either be subjected to physical
    punishment, or if he remains stubborn, let him be expelled from the
    monastery.

    CHAPTER 72: CONCERNING THE GOOD ZEAL WHICH MONKS OUGHT TO HAVE
</h2>
<p>
    Just as there is an evil zeal of bitterness which separates from God and
    leads to hell, so there is a good zeal which separates from vices and
    leads to God and to eternal life. By most fervent love therefore let
    monks exercise this zeal, that is, let them see to it that in honor they
    prefer one another. Let them most patiently tolerate their weaknesses
    whether physical or of character; let them compete in yielding
    obedience; let none follow what he judges convenient to himself, but
    rather what he judges convenient to another; in chaste love let them
    exercise brotherly charity; let them fear God; let them love their abbot
    with sincere and humble affection; on no account let them put anything
    above Christ; and may He bring us all alike to eternal life.
