                                    <p>Below is a draft copy of the covenant that all members will be asked to sign during our initial gathering. It is made available well in advance so that you can better discern whether the interMission community is a good fit for you in this season of life.</p>

                                    <blockquote>"As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another." - Proverbs 27:17</blockquote>
                                    <p>We believe that God has called us together for this sacred season to cultivate our souls and deepen our love for Jesus. We recognize that spiritual formation cannot happen in isolation—we need each other for the journey ahead.
                                    For this reason, we joyfully commit to one another:</p>
                                    <h2>Our Three Commitments</h2>
                                    <h3>Show Up Faithfully</h3>
                                    <p>We will prioritize our weekly gatherings like an important work meeting or date night. If we must miss, we'll notify the group ahead of time. We understand that our presence matters—not just for our own growth, but because others are counting on us to be part of their formation journey.</p>
                                    <h3>Share Life Honestly</h3> 
                                    <p>We will come with open hearts, ready to listen deeply and share our real selves and spiritual experiences. We'll practice confidentiality with what we hear and offer gracious support rather than trying to fix one another.</p>
                                    <h3>Engage the Practices Wholeheartedly</h3>
                                    <p>We will approach each week's spiritual practices with sincere effort, both in our group time and in our personal lives. We understand that formation requires active participation, not passive attendance.</p>
                                    <h2>Our Commitment Timeline</h2>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Initial Commitment:</strong> September 7, 2025 through Christmas Break (December 20, 2025)</li>
                                        <li><strong>Extended Commitment:</strong> January 11, 2026 through May 9, 2026</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>We recognize that Christmas Break provides a natural time to reassess our commitment. While we hope everyone will journey with us for the full year, we understand that circumstances may require some to step away at that point.</p>
                                    <h2>Time Investment</h2>
                                    <p>We want to be transparent about the time this journey requires. For each week, plan for up to 2 hours for an in-person group gathering and up to 5 hours for personal spiritual practices. In reality, <i>your personal practice time will often be much shorter</i>, but we want you to know the upper limit as you consider this commitment.</p>
                                    <h2>Our Heart</h2>
                                    <p>If you're not ready to make this level of commitment, that's completely understandable—but we ask that you wait to join until you are. We believe this sacred work requires our wholehearted engagement, and we want to honor both your journey and ours by being clear about expectations from the start.</p>
                                    <p>We're excited to see what God will do in and through us as we cultivate the sacred time between life's seasons together.</p>
