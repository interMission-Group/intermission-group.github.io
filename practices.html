											<h3>Opening Reflection Questions</h3>
											<p>Take a moment to consider: <strong>What comes to mind when you hear the word "repentance"?</strong> How would you describe your own experience with repentance—both the easy moments and the difficult ones? What aspects of repentance have challenged or deepened your spiritual journey?</p>

											<h3>The Language of Repentance</h3>
											<p>The Hebrew word for repentance is <em><strong>teshuvah</strong></em>, which literally means "to turn" or "to return" or—a complete change of direction back toward God. It is often used in the context of prophetic calls to repentance. Hebrew also has the word <em><strong>nacham</strong></em>, which means to be sorry, regret, or relent. It can be used of people and even of God (e.g., 1 Sam 15:11) and can suggest either a change in intent or simply an expression of sorrow. The Greek New Testament uses <em><strong>metanoia</strong></em>, meaning "a change of mind" or "afterthought"—not merely feeling sorry, but a fundamental transformation of thinking that leads to a changed life. As we discuss and practice repentance, let's try to remember to draw upon this rich constellation of ideas.</p>

											<h3>Augustine's Framework</h3>
											<p>In his <em>Confessions</em>, St. Augustine provides a profound framework for true repentance that begins with revelation rather than introspection: first, recognizing the holiness of God; second, confessing the heinousness nature of our sin in light of His holiness; and finally, embracing God's grace and loving forgiveness through Christ. Notice the order—repentance starts with seeing God rightly, not seeing ourselves rightly. It ends not in despair but in reveling in the grace of God.</p>

											<h3><a href="readings/finney_true_and_false_repentance.html" target="_blank">True and False Repentance</a></h3>
											<p>We'll begin our exploration with Charles Finney's lecture, reading the <a href="readings/finney_true_and_false_repentance.html#introduction" target="_blank">introduction</a> and <a href="readings/finney_true_and_false_repentance.html#change-of-heart" target="_blank">"A Change of Heart"</a> sections together now. This will set the foundation for our week of practice, where we'll discover that genuine repentance produces not mere regret, but a fundamental reorientation of our hearts toward God.</p>

											<h3>A Note on Journaling</h3>
											<p>Throughout our journey together, I encourage you to keep a notebook dedicated to your interMission experience. This isn't meant to be burdensome—simply jot down insights that strike you, questions that arise, or moments when God seems to be speaking. This will, hopefully, encourage synthesis of your experiences over time and prepare you for sharing with our community each week.</p>

													that we have sinned against you<br>
													by what we have done,<br>
													and by what we have left undone.<br><br>
													We have not loved you with our<br>
													whole heart and mind and strength.<br>
													We have not fully loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
													We have not always had in us the mind of Christ.<br><br>
													You alone know how often we have grieved you<br>
													by wasting your gifts, by wandering from your ways.<br><br>
													Forgive us, we pray you, most merciful Father;<br>
													And free us from our sin.<br>
													Renew in us the grace and strength of your Holy Spirit,<br>
													for the sake of Jesus Christ your Son our Savior.<br><br>
													Amen.

											<h3>Opening Reflection Questions</h3>
											<p>Are you familiar with the concept of a rule of life? If so, what sort of connotation does it have for you? Have you ever written a rule of life? If so, what catalyzed that process and how was the experience of creating it. How was the experience of living it?</p>

											<h3>Definitions</h3>
											<p>"A Rule of Life is a trellis that helps us abide in Christ and become more fruitful spiritually. It is an intentional, conscious plan to keep God at the center of everything we do." - <a href = "https://www.emotionallyhealthy.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/RULE-OF-LIFE-WORKBOOK.pdf">Peter Scazzero</a></p>											
											<p>"A rule of life is a set of rhythms and practices we choose to live out in order to make space for our highest priorities, values, relationships, and callings." -- <a href="https://evangelicalcatholic.org/what-is-a-rule-of-life/">The Evangelical Catholic</a></p>

											<p>"A rule of life is a schedule and set of practices and relational rhythms that help us create space in our busy world for us to be with Jesus, become like Jesus, and do what Jesus did—to live "to the full" (John 10v10) in his kingdom, and in alignment with our deepest passions and priorities." -- <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5852ec829f7456cfcc0e1c5a/t/5e17be5d7cba366ace1df6e1/1578614383140/ptw_ruleoflife_workbook_.pdf"> Practicing the Way / Bridgetown Church</a></p>

											<h3>The Rule of Life in Scripture</h3>
											<p>While the phrase "rule of life" may sound foreign to Protestant ears, the concept is deeply biblical. The Torah itself provided a comprehensive rule of life for Israel—structuring their days, weeks, and years around encounter with God. Consider how the Shema commanded: "These commandments that I give you today are to be on your hearts... Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up" (Deuteronomy 6:6-7).</p>

											<p>Jesus himself lived according to intentional rhythms. The Gospels reveal his "rule":</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Jesus regularly sought solitude to pray: "Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed." (Mark 1:35)</li>
												<li>Jesus regularly worshipped in community: "He went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and on the Sabbath day he went into the synagogue, as was his custom." (Luke 4:16)</li>
												<li>Jesus regularly withdrew for rest and renewal: After intense ministry, "But Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed." (Luke 5:16)</li>
												<li>Jesus regularly practiced fasting and taught his followers to do the same: His 40-day fast (Matthew 4:2), plus teaching that assumed his followers would fast (Matthew 6:16-18)</li>
												<li>Jesus regularly participated in remembrance and celebration: Regularly going to Jerusalem for Passover and other feasts</li>
												<li>Jesus regularly shared life in close community: Living, ministering, traveling, and sharing meals with the twelve apostles.</li>
											</ul>

											<p>Notice that Jesus' rule wasn't rigid legalism but a life-giving structure that enabled him to fulfill his mission while maintaining intimacy with the Father.</p>

											<h3>History</h3>
											<p>When learning about rules of life, you will quickly encounter St. Benedict (~480-547 AD), who is considered the founder of Western monasticism. His 'Rule' provided structure for communal monastic life, informing both relationships within the community and individual spiritual formation under the guidance of the abbot.</p>

											<p>Benedict has a compelling story: as a young man of about 20, he fled the moral bankruptcy of Roman society to live as a hermit. Despite being alone in a cave, word of his virtues and character began to spread, eventually attracting a community of disciples. After challenging experiences with this initial community, he founded a monastery at about age 50 that became the foundation of the Benedictine order. Benedict, influenced by earlier Rules, wrote his Rule in his later years—not as abstract theory but as wisdom distilled from decades of communal spiritual living.</p>

											<h3>This Week's Journey</h3>
											<p>This week is simply an introduction. I'm convinced that everyone already has a rule of life—some are just more intentional about it than others. It's also been my observation that those who live with greater intentionality tend to experience more consistent spiritual growth. This week, we'll learn more about rules of life and document what we're already doing. This <em>isn't aspirational</em>; it's observational. After exploring various spiritual practices over the coming months, we'll return to the rule of life to help you craft one that incorporates any helpful resources that you've discovered. But for now, we simply observe and record what we've been doing.</p>

											<h3>A Note on Grace</h3>
											<p>A rule of life is not about earning God's favor or proving our devotion. It's about creating space to receive what God freely offers. As Dallas Willard reminds us, "Grace is not opposed to effort, it is opposed to earning." A rule of life is simply our effort to position ourselves to receive grace.</p>

													Take 20-30 minutes to honestly observe and record your current rhythms and practices. Remember, this <em>is not aspirational</em>—simply document what you actually do. You might consider:<br><br>
													<strong>Daily Rhythms</strong>: When do you wake/sleep? When do you pray (even briefly)? When do you eat? What routines begin and end your day?<br><br>
													<strong>Weekly Rhythms:</strong> What does Sabbath look like for you? Church attendance? Regular commitments? Time with family/friends?<br><br>
													<strong>Monthly/Seasonal/Annual Rhythms:</strong> What patterns exist over longer periods? Fasting? Giving? Practicing hospitality? Retreat? Service? Celebration?<br><br>
													<strong>Practices:</strong> What spiritual practices do you currently engage (even sporadically)? Bible reading? Prayer types? Worship? Service?<br><br>
													<strong>Relationships:</strong> What rhythms exist in your key relationships? Regular meals? Phone calls? Time with metors? Time with mentees? Time with community?<br><br>
													This is simply data gathering about your current life patterns. No one will judge you for your honesty.
