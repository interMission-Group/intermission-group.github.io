											<h3>Opening Reflection Questions</h3>
											<p>Take a moment to consider: <strong>What comes to mind when you hear the word "repentance"?</strong> How would you describe your own experience with repentance—both the easy moments and the difficult ones? What aspects of repentance have challenged or deepened your spiritual journey?</p>

											<h3>The Language of Repentance</h3>
											<p>The Hebrew word for repentance is <em><strong>teshuvah</strong></em>, which literally means "to turn" or "to return" or—a complete change of direction back toward God. It is often used in the context of prophetic calls to repentance. Hebrew also has the word <em><strong>nacham</strong></em>, which means to be sorry, regret, or relent. It can be used of people and even of God (e.g., 1 Sam 15:11) and can suggest either a change in intent or simply an expression of sorrow. The Greek New Testament uses <em><strong>metanoia</strong></em>, meaning "a change of mind" or "afterthought"—not merely feeling sorry, but a fundamental transformation of thinking that leads to a changed life. As we discuss and practice repentance, let's try to remember to draw upon this rich constellation of ideas.</p>

											<h3>Augustine's Framework</h3>
											<p>In his <em>Confessions</em>, St. Augustine provides a profound framework for true repentance that begins with revelation rather than introspection: first, recognizing the holiness of God; second, confessing the heinousness nature of our sin in light of His holiness; and finally, embracing God's grace and loving forgiveness through Christ. Notice the order—repentance starts with seeing God rightly, not seeing ourselves rightly. It ends not in despair but in reveling in the grace of God.</p>

											<h3><a href="readings/finney_true_and_false_repentance.html" target="_blank">True and False Repentance</a></h3>
											<p>We'll begin our exploration with Charles Finney's lecture, reading the <a href="readings/finney_true_and_false_repentance.html#introduction" target="_blank">introduction</a> and <a href="readings/finney_true_and_false_repentance.html#change-of-heart" target="_blank">"A Change of Heart"</a> sections together now. This will set the foundation for our week of practice, where we'll discover that genuine repentance produces not mere regret, but a fundamental reorientation of our hearts toward God.</p>

											<h3>A Note on Journaling</h3>
											<p>Throughout our journey together, I encourage you to keep a notebook dedicated to your interMission experience. This isn't meant to be burdensome—simply jot down insights that strike you, questions that arise, or moments when God seems to be speaking. This will, hopefully, encourage synthesis of your experiences over time and prepare you for sharing with our community each week.</p>

											<h3>Opening Reflection Questions</h3>
											<p>Are you familiar with the concept of a rule of life? If so, what sort of connotation does it have for you? Have you ever written a rule of life? If so, what catalyzed that process and how was the experience of creating it. How was the experience of living it?</p>

											<h3>Definitions</h3>
											<p>"A Rule of Life is a trellis that helps us abide in Christ and become more fruitful spiritually. It is an intentional, conscious plan to keep God at the center of everything we do." - <a href = "https://www.emotionallyhealthy.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/RULE-OF-LIFE-WORKBOOK.pdf">Peter Scazzero</a></p>											
											<p>"A rule of life is a set of rhythms and practices we choose to live out in order to make space for our highest priorities, values, relationships, and callings." -- <a href="https://evangelicalcatholic.org/what-is-a-rule-of-life/">The Evangelical Catholic</a></p>

											<p>"A rule of life is a schedule and set of practices and relational rhythms that help us create space in our busy world for us to be with Jesus, become like Jesus, and do what Jesus did—to live "to the full" (John 10v10) in his kingdom, and in alignment with our deepest passions and priorities." -- <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5852ec829f7456cfcc0e1c5a/t/5e17be5d7cba366ace1df6e1/1578614383140/ptw_ruleoflife_workbook_.pdf"> Practicing the Way / Bridgetown Church</a></p>

											<h3>The Rule of Life in Scripture</h3>
											<p>While the phrase "rule of life" may sound foreign to Protestant ears, the concept is deeply biblical. The Torah itself provided a comprehensive rule of life for Israel—structuring their days, weeks, and years around encounter with God. Consider how the Shema commanded: "These commandments that I give you today are to be on your hearts... Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up" (Deuteronomy 6:6-7).</p>

											<p>Jesus himself lived according to intentional rhythms. The Gospels reveal his "rule":</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Jesus regularly sought solitude to pray: "Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed." (Mark 1:35)</li>
												<li>Jesus regularly worshipped in community: "He went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and on the Sabbath day he went into the synagogue, as was his custom." (Luke 4:16)</li>
												<li>Jesus regularly withdrew for rest and renewal: After intense ministry, "But Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed." (Luke 5:16)</li>
												<li>Jesus regularly practiced fasting and taught his followers to do the same: His 40-day fast (Matthew 4:2), plus teaching that assumed his followers would fast (Matthew 6:16-18)</li>
												<li>Jesus regularly participated in remembrance and celebration: Regularly going to Jerusalem for Passover and other feasts</li>
												<li>Jesus regularly shared life in close community: Living, ministering, traveling, and sharing meals with the twelve apostles.</li>
											</ul>

											<p>Notice that Jesus' rule wasn't rigid legalism but a life-giving structure that enabled him to fulfill his mission while maintaining intimacy with the Father.</p>

											<h3>History</h3>
											<p>When learning about rules of life, you will quickly encounter St. Benedict (~480-547 AD), who is considered the founder of Western monasticism. His 'Rule' provided structure for communal monastic life, informing both relationships within the community and individual spiritual formation under the guidance of the abbot.</p>

											<p>Benedict has a compelling story: as a young man of about 20, he fled the moral bankruptcy of Roman society to live as a hermit. Despite being alone in a cave, word of his virtues and character began to spread, eventually attracting a community of disciples. After challenging experiences with this initial community, he founded a monastery at about age 50 that became the foundation of the Benedictine order. Benedict, influenced by earlier Rules, wrote his Rule in his later years—not as abstract theory but as wisdom distilled from decades of communal spiritual living.</p>

											<h3>This Week's Journey</h3>
											<p>This week is simply an introduction. I'm convinced that everyone already has a rule of life—some are just more intentional about it than others. It's also been my observation that those who live with greater intentionality tend to experience more consistent spiritual growth. This week, we'll learn more about rules of life and document what we're already doing. This <em>isn't aspirational</em>; it's observational. After exploring various spiritual practices over the coming months, we'll return to the rule of life to help you craft one that incorporates any helpful resources that you've discovered. But for now, we simply observe and record what we've been doing.</p>

											<h3>A Note on Grace</h3>
											<p>A rule of life is not about earning God's favor or proving our devotion. It's about creating space to receive what God freely offers. As Dallas Willard reminds us, "Grace is not opposed to effort, it is opposed to earning." A rule of life is simply our effort to position ourselves to receive grace.</p>

											<h3>Opening Reflection Questions</h3>
											<p>When you think about Scripture, what's the first thing that comes to mind? What draws you to Scripture, and what, if anything, causes you to neglect it? Consider both the seasons when God's Word felt alive and vibrant, and times when it seemed distant or difficult.</p>

											<h3>The Foundation of Faith</h3>
											<p>Christian faith rests entirely upon God's self-revelation. As creator of all that was, is, and will be, God has left His fingerprints throughout creation. The beauty and glory we witness in the natural world reflects God's own character and, for those with eyes to see, reveals "his invisible attributes" and "eternal power and divine nature" (Romans 1:20). Some theologians also argue that God has also revealed himself through conscience, reason, and the sweep of history itself---all of this is what we call general revelation.</p>

											<p>Yet I have never met, nor have I even heard of, anyone who discovered the Gospel through general revelation alone. The clues embedded in creation, while pointing toward a Creator, cannot lead us to the cross or the glories of the resurrection. Thanks be to God that He has not left us groping in the dark, piecing together fragments of His character from the world around us! By His grace, God has chosen to make himself known specifically for the purpose of redemption.</p>

											<p>The Bible contains God's specific self-revelation. Despite having numerous human authors writing across millennia in various literary genres, Scripture maintains a coherent theme runs throughout: a holy and loving God pursuing and redeeming an undeserving people. This remarkable coherence results from the work of the Holy Spirit, who is the revealer of truth (John 16:13). As Paul reminds Timothy, "All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work" (2 Timothy 3:16-17). Through this inspired revelation, we can know who God is and who we are in relation to him.</p>

											<h3>The Written Word and the Word Made Flesh</h3>
											<p>Let me be clear: we do not worship the Bible, but the God of the Bible. God's ultimate revelation came in the God-Man Christ Jesus, the Word made flesh (John 1:14). It is Jesus who is "the image of the invisible God" (Colossians 1:15) and in whom "all the fullness of God dwelled" (Colossians 1:19). So, the answer to the perennial question "What is God like?" is "God is like Jesus, because Jesus is God." But this leads us to ask, "Who is Jesus?"---which draws us back to engage with the inspired revelation of the written Word.</p>

											<h3>An Invitation to Deeper Engagement</h3>
											<p>Depending on your tradition and spiritual journey, it is possible to follow Jesus faithfully for years while somehow missing the major themes and threads that weave Scripture together. Many believers attend worship services and Bible studies regularly yet remain unfamiliar with entire books of the Bible, much less the overarching narrative that connects Genesis to Revelation. I believe this represents a form of spiritual malnourishment. You can survive and even grow, but you will be stunted because you are not accessing the fullness of what God has deemed to be essential revelation.</p>

											<p>This week, we will explore five distinct yet complementary ways of engaging with Scripture. Each practice offers a different lens through which to encounter God's Word---from reading entire books to diving deep into individual passages, from study to prayer to contemplative meditation. Our goal is not to master techniques but to be equipped with knowledge of various ways to grow through engaging with Scripture.</p>

													<li><strong>John 6:63:</strong> The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you---they are full of the Spirit and life.</li>

												</ul>
												<blockquote>
													O Lord Jesus Christ, open the eyes of my heart that I may hear your Word, and understand and do your will, for I am a sojourner upon the Earth. Hide not your commandments from me, but open my eyes, that I may perceive the wonders of your Law. Speak unto me the hidden and secret things of your wisdom. On you do I set my hope, O my God, that you shall enlighten my mind and understanding with the light of your knowledge; not only to cherish those things which are written, but to do them; For you are the enlightenment of those who lie in darkness, and from you comes every good deed and every gift.
												</blockquote>
												<ul>
													<li><strong>Exercise: Bible Reading (Part 1)</strong></li>
												</ul>
												
												<p class="indent">We often forget that the Bible is a book of books, and some of those books are meant to be read in a single sitting. Individual verses may speak to us, but focusing exclusively on bits and pieces is likely to leave us ignorant of the original author's main intent. The gospels and epistles are particularly suited for reading at one time. Think about it---if you received a letter from your childhood best friend, wouldn't you read it straight through? Would you skip around and read only certain parts?</p>

												<p class="indent">Today's practice is simple. Pick an epistle and read through it in its entirety in one sitting. Select a place free from distraction, turn off your phone, pray for the presence of the Holy Spirit, and read for the scope of what the author is saying. Why did they write this letter and what are they communicating? Record your observations in your journal.</p>

												<p class="indent">You can pick any epistle you like. If you have no preference, I'd suggest reading 1 Peter and 2 Peter. Since they are letters written to gentile believers living in a culture hostile to their faith, there may be resonance with our own lives and experiences.</p>

													but will accomplish what I desire and achieve the purpose for which I sent it.</li>
													<li><strong>Prayer:</strong> A prayer from the Reformed tradition</li>
												</ul>
												<blockquote>
													Gracious God, we do not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from your mouth. Make us hungry for this heavenly food, that it may nourish us today in ways of eternal life; through Jesus Christ, the bread of heaven.<br><br>

												<ul>
													<li><strong>Exercise: Bible Reading (Part 2)</strong></li>
												</ul>
												<p  class="indent">
													While reading through entire books provides invaluable perspective, it's not always practical for daily engagement. A gospel like Luke would take about two and a half hours to read completely---manageable on a retreat, but challenging for regular practice.<br><br>
													There's also value in reading more slowly and deliberately, allowing us to digest what God might be communicating to us. This is where we can engage Scripture in a more intentionally interactive way. There are many approaches; for simplicity, I have selected one called the SOAP method. Normally you would begin with prayer and then select a passage. For this practice, I recommend that you use Ephesians 2:1-10 and follow the outline below:
												</p>

												<p class="indent"><strong>Scripture:</strong> Write down any verses or phrases that strike you.</p>

												<p class="indent"><strong>Observation:</strong> What do you see in the passage? Who is the author and audience? What is the genre? Does the text contain descriptions, imperatives, exhortations, or something else?</p>

												<p class="indent"><strong>Application:</strong> Ask the Holy Spirit to reveal how the passage could be applied to your life. What impact does it make on your beliefs, attitudes, or actions?</p>

												<p class="indent"><strong>Prayer:</strong> Respond to God in prayer. Give thanks for His revelation and how He is applying it to your life. Ask for grace to help you apply this truth.</p>

												<ul>
													<li><strong>Reflection Questions:</strong> What was this experience like for you? Are you likely to engage in it again? Why or why not?</li>

												<h3>Practice 3</h3>
												<ul>
													<li><strong>Luke 24:27:</strong> And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning Himself.</li>
													<li><strong>Prayer:</strong> A prayer from the Reformed tradition</li>
												</ul>
												<blockquote>
													Living God, help us so to hear your holy Word that we may truly understand;<br>
													that, understanding, we may believe and<br>
													believing, we may follow in all faithfulness and obedience,<br>
													seeking your honor and glory in all that we do;<br>
													through Christ our Lord.<br><br>
													Amen.
												</blockquote>
												<ul>
													<li><strong>Exercise: Personal Bible Study</strong></li>
												</ul>
												<p class="indent">Bible reading as described above is a great spiritual discipline, but there will likely be times when you'll want to go even deeper. When you want to better understand the historical context of the original author and audience, explore the nuance of a critical word or phrase, or understand how Scripture refers to and interprets itself (which it does frequently!), this is Bible study.</p>

												<p class="indent">The best starting point is a good study Bible, which will have insightful introductions to each book, cultural and archaeological insights for specific verses, and footnotes pointing out alternative translations and connections to other passages. In addition, an excellent electronic resource is the Blue Letter Bible (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/">https://www.blueletterbible.org/</a>). Though it has fewer translations than BibleGateway, it provides easy access to cross-references, commentaries, and Bible dictionaries. It also provides Strong's Numbers, which assigns a code to every word in the original languages so you can easily look up their exact meaning and usage in other passages. This a gift to all serious students of the Word of God.</p>

												<p class="indent">For today's exercise, use the <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/">Blue Letter Bible</a> to study Romans 8:1-17. Read through the entire section first, then go back and examine each verse. Is anything confusing or intriguing? Use the 'Cross-Refs' tools to identify verses with related ideas. Use the 'Interlinear' tab to explore other uses of the underlying Greek word for 'free' in Romans 8:2 (hint, click on G1659). Explore the wealth of information available.</p>

												<h3>Practice 4</h3>
												<ul>
													<li><strong>Hebrews 4:12:</strong> For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.</li>
													<li><strong>Prayer:</strong> From the Book of Common Prayer (1552 edition)</li>
												</ul>
												<blockquote>
													Blessed Lord, you have caused all Holy Scripture to be written for our learning - grant us that we may in such a way hear them, read, mark, learn and inwardly digest them; that by patience and comfort of your holy Word, we may embrace and ever hold fast the blessed hope of everlasting life, which you have given us in our Savior Jesus Christ.<br><br>
													Amen
												</blockquote>
												<ul>
													<li><strong>Exercise: Praying Scripture</strong></li>
												</ul>
												<p class="indent">Ideally all of our prayers would be informed by Scripture, but there are also Scriptures that are meant to be prayed and sung---chief among these are the Psalms. When we pray the Psalms, not only are we praying in agreement with the communion of saints across time and place, but we can be confident that we are praying in agreement with God. The Psalms provide an avenue to pour out our joys, sorrows, frustrations, rage, and earnest desires before Him when our own words fail us.</p>

												<p class="indent">Today's exercise is simple: pick a Psalm and pray it aloud. Read it through once first to catch the sentiment, then bring your heart into alignment with that sentiment and pray it to God. Since I cannot know your spiritual state today, I recommend Psalm 27, which is one of my favorites. However, if you know of another Psalm that better suits the current state of your soul, please feel free to pray through that Psalm instead.</p>

													<li><strong>Prayer:</strong> A prayer from St. Jerome</li>
												</ul>
												<blockquote>
													Lord, thou hast given us thy Word for a light to shine upon our path;<br>
													grant us so to meditate on that Word, and to follow its teaching,<br>
													that we may find in it the light that shines more and more until the perfect day;<br>

												<ul>
													<li><strong>Exercise: Lectio Divina (Divine Reading)</strong></li>
												</ul>
												<p class="indent">
													As with the formation of a rule of life, if you look up <em>lectio divina</em> you will soon encounter references to St. Benedict of Nursia. As you might remember from <a href="readings/rule_st_benedict_selected_chapters.html#chapter-48" target="_blank">Chapter 48</a> of his <em>Rule</em>, manual work was to be interspersed with 'spiritual reading', which in Latin is <em>lectio divina</em>. The spiritual reading in St. Benedict's community was a slow and contemplative reading of Scripture, essentially a meditation. Though Benedict didn't invent this method of prayerful Scripture reading, his name is now permanently attached to the practice.<br><br>
													Just as Bible study differs from Bible reading, and both differ from praying Scripture, it's best to think of <em>lectio divina</em> as a related but distinct spiritual practice. Historically, it has primarily been a communal practice where one individual led others through the steps below. While you're encouraged to try this at home, you might have a richer experience practicing this with others.<br><br>
													Please use Isaiah 40:25-26 to practice <em>lectio divina</em> following the guidelines below. The four traditional steps are noted by their Latin names.<br><br>
													<strong>Preparation:</strong> Turn off devices. Get into a position that combines comfort and alertness. Take a few deep breaths and invite the Holy Spirit to speak to you through Scripture.<br><br>
													<strong><em>Lectio</em> (Reading/Listening):</strong> Select a short passage---ideally a few sentences at most. Read it slowly, deliberately, and aloud, allowing you to interact with Scripture through seeing, hearing, and speaking the Word. Rest for a moment. Did a word, phrase, or image strike you? Read the passage a second time, again slowly and aloud, listening for what calls for attention. You may read a third time to confirm the word, phrase, or image that God impressed upon you.<br><br>
													<strong><em>Meditatio</em> (Meditating):</strong> Take the word or phrase and ruminate on it. If alone, repeat it aloud; if with others, repeat it in your mind. Do this slowly and deliberately. How is this connecting with your life? What is God trying to communicate?<br><br>
													<strong><em>Oratio</em> (Praying):</strong> Take the word, phrase, or image and its connection to your life and bring them before God in prayer. This will be entirely based on what God has been communicating---it could be thanksgiving, praise, grief, repentance, or petition. Simply respond to and interact with God.<br><br>
													<strong><em>Contemplatio</em> (Contemplating):</strong> Cease active prayer and simply rest in His presence. Be still and silent before Him. Gaze upon His beauty and revel in the miracle that the God who created the universe invites you to commune with Him.<br><br>
													<strong>Response:</strong> If you feel convicted during this practice, write it down in your journal with a date by which you will act. Did you feel nudged to ask for or extend forgiveness? Were you convicted to fast? Asked to write an encouraging note? Write it down and do it!

											<h3>Opening Reflection Questions</h3>
											<p>What has been your experience with memorizing God's Word? What might God be inviting you to discover about this ancient practice?</p>

											<h3>A Personal Story of Spiritual Authority</h3>
											<p>When I was still a seminary student in Boston, I had the privilege of meeting Bishop Gilbert Thompson. To this day, I struggle to put into words exactly how to describe him. He simply had presence. A weighty, undeniable spiritual authority surrounded him. You could feel it when he was in the room. And when he prayed, it felt as if heaven itself drew near. Some men quote scripture. The Bishop prayed it. From memory, he'd pray whole paragraphs straight from the Word. That's when I learned that when Scripture is so deeply embedded in your soul that it shapes your prayers, you pray with a different kind of authority—an unwavering confidence that you are praying in alignment with God's will.</p>

											<h3>Scripture Designed for Memory</h3>
											<p>The Old Testament itself reveals God's intention for His words to be memorable. Psalm 119, a great celebration of God's Word, is structured as an acrostic poem—each section beginning with consecutive letters of the Hebrew alphabet, creating a memorable framework for meditation. Throughout the Hebrew Bible, we find parallelism, repetition, wordplay, and rhythmic patterns that make the text not just readable but memorable. While we cannot prove that all the prophets sang their prophecies, we do know that prophecy and music were often intertwined (1 Samuel 10:5-6), suggesting that God's revelations came in forms designed to lodge in human memory.</p>

											<h3>The Practice in Jesus' Time</h3>
											<p>While popular stories about Jewish children memorizing the entire Torah by age 12 are not historically supported, we do know that memorization played a critical role in first-century Jewish life. Jesus himself reveals the fruit of a mind saturated with Scripture. When tempted in the wilderness (Matthew 4), he responds to each temptation not by consulting a scroll but by quoting from Deuteronomy—words clearly treasured in his heart. Throughout his ministry, Jesus weaves Scripture naturally into his teaching, often beginning with "It is written..." and proceeding to quote extensive passages from memory. His final words on the cross echo memorized psalms, showing how deeply God's Word sustained him even in his darkest hour.</p>

											<h3>The Early Church's Practice</h3>
											<p>The early Christians developed systematic memorization practices driven by both devotion and necessity. New Testament manuscripts were rare and expensive, and personal Bible ownership was virtually impossible for ordinary believers. In response, entire communities organized their lives around memorizing Scripture.</p>

											<p>The evidence is remarkable: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origen" target="_blank">Origen's</a> father required him to memorize passages daily from childhood, and Origen is said to have eventually internalized most of both Testaments. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Chrysostom" target="_blank">John Chrysostom</a> memorized the entire New Testament during a two-year retreat. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachomius_the_Great" target="_blank">Pachomian</a> monastic communities required new members to memorize twenty Psalms or two epistles just to join, with the goal of eventually memorizing the entire New Testament and Psalms.</p>

											<p>These feats of memorization weren't exceptional, they were expected. Presbyters were required to know all 150 Psalms by heart. Irish monastics would gather daily to recite the entire Psalter from memory, and medieval monks incorporated memorization into their daily work.</p>

											<h3>Why Memorize Scripture Today?</h3>
											<p>In our age of instant digital access to dozens of Bible translations, why invest the effort required for memorization?</p>

											<p><strong>To resist temptation:</strong> Like Jesus in the wilderness, we need God's truth readily available when facing spiritual attack. As the psalmist declares, "I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you" (Psalm 119:11).</p>

											<p><strong>To be ready for ministry:</strong> When we encounter someone in need, we can offer the living Word of God. Whether evangelizing, encouraging, counseling, or correcting, memorized Scripture equips us for spontaneous ministry.</p>

											<p><strong>To transform our prayers:</strong> When we pray Scripture, we pray with confidence, knowing we're aligned with God's will. Like Bishop Thompson, we can bring heaven near through Spirit-filled, Word-saturated prayer.</p>

											<p><strong>To renew our minds:</strong> Scripture calls us to be "transformed by the renewing of our minds" (Romans 12:2), and modern neuroscience confirms that memorization practices do change brain structure. Through memorizing God's Word, we are participating in the very transformation Paul describes.</p>

											<h3>Wisdom from a Seasoned Practitioner</h3>
											<p>Dr. Andrew Davis, author of "An Approach to Extended Memorization of Scripture", has memorized over 40 entire books of the Bible. He advocates memorizing entire books rather than isolated verses because understanding the context prevents misunderstanding. His practical method emphasizes several key principles:</p>

											<ul>
												<li><strong>Review before adding:</strong> Always prioritize reviewing previously memorized material over learning new verses</li>
												<li><strong>Space your repetition:</strong> Multiple shorter sessions surpass single intensive efforts</li>
												<li><strong>Include verse numbers:</strong> This helps prevent skipping verses and enables quick reference in ministry</li>
												<li><strong>Engage visual memory:</strong> "Read each new verse ten times, covering each word as though photographing it with your eyes"</li>
											</ul>

											<p>This week's exercises follow Dr. Davis' methodology.</p>

											<h3>An Invitation to Begin</h3>
											<p>This week isn't about mastering memorization techniques or feeling overwhelmed by others' achievements. It's about taking a first step, or perhaps returning to a practice you've neglected, with fresh understanding and realistic expectations. Whether you memorize a single verse or entire chapters, the goal remains the same: to hide God's Word in your heart, that it might transform you from the inside out.</p>

											<p>As you begin this journey, be patient with yourself. The saints who memorized entire books didn't achieve this overnight—they built slowly, verse by verse, sustained by the conviction that God's Word is "more precious than gold... sweeter than honey" (Psalm 19:10).</p>
