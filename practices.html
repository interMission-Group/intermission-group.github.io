											<h3>Opening Reflection Questions</h3>
											<p>Take a moment to consider: <strong>What comes to mind when you hear the word "repentance"?</strong> How would you describe your own experience with repentance—both the easy moments and the difficult ones? What aspects of repentance have challenged or deepened your spiritual journey?</p>

											<h3>The Language of Repentance</h3>
											<p>The Hebrew word for repentance is <em><strong>teshuvah</strong></em>, which literally means "to turn" or "to return" or—a complete change of direction back toward God. It is often used in the context of prophetic calls to repentance. Hebrew also has the word <em><strong>nacham</strong></em>, which means to be sorry, regret, or relent. It can be used of people and even of God (e.g., 1 Sam 15:11) and can suggest either a change in intent or simply an expression of sorrow. The Greek New Testament uses <em><strong>metanoia</strong></em>, meaning "a change of mind" or "afterthought"—not merely feeling sorry, but a fundamental transformation of thinking that leads to a changed life. As we discuss and practice repentance, let's try to remember to draw upon this rich constellation of ideas.</p>

											<h3>Augustine's Framework</h3>
											<p>In his <em>Confessions</em>, St. Augustine provides a profound framework for true repentance that begins with revelation rather than introspection: first, recognizing the holiness of God; second, confessing the heinousness nature of our sin in light of His holiness; and finally, embracing God's grace and loving forgiveness through Christ. Notice the order—repentance starts with seeing God rightly, not seeing ourselves rightly. It ends not in despair but in the indulgence of His boundless grace.</p>

											<h3><a href="readings/finney_true_and_false_repentance.html" target="_blank">True and False Repentance</a></h3>
											<p>We'll begin our exploration with Charles Finney's lecture, reading the <a href="readings/finney_true_and_false_repentance.html#introduction" target="_blank">introduction</a> and <a href="readings/finney_true_and_false_repentance.html#change-of-heart" target="_blank">"A Change of Heart"</a> section together now. This will set the foundation for our week of practice, where we'll discover that genuine repentance produces not mere regret, but a fundamental reorientation of our hearts toward God.</p>

											<h3>A Note on Journaling</h3>
											<p>Throughout our journey together, I encourage you to keep a notebook dedicated to your interMission experience. This isn't meant to be burdensome—simply jot down insights that strike you, questions that arise, or moments when God seems to be speaking. This will, hopefully, encourage synthesis of your experiences over time and prepare you for sharing with our community each week.</p>

											<div class="box">
												<h3>Practice 1</h3>
												<ul>
													<li><strong>Psalm 32:</strong> Read and meditate</li>
													<li><strong>Prayer:</strong> Penitential Prayer of St. Augustine:</li>
												</ul>
												<blockquote>
													O Lord,<br>
													The house of my soul is narrow;<br>
													enlarge it that you may enter in.<br>
													It is ruinous, O repair it!<br>
													It displeases Your sight.<br>
													I confess it, I know.<br>
													But who shall cleanse it,<br>
													to whom shall I cry but to you?<br>
													Cleanse me from my secret faults, O Lord,<br>
													and spare Your servant from strange sins.<br>
													<em>- St. Augustine of Hippo (AD 354-430)</em>
												</blockquote>
												<ul>
													<li><strong>Reading:</strong> True & False Repentance - <a href="readings/finney_true_and_false_repentance.html#repentance-leading-to-salvation" target="_blank">"Repentance Leading to Salvation"</a></li>
													<li><strong>Reflection Question:</strong> How does Finney's description of genuine repentance leading to confession and restitution challenge or confirm your understanding of what it means to truly turn from sin?</li>
												</ul>
											</div>

											<div class="box">
												<h3>Practice 2</h3>
												<p>The church has long recognized seven "penitential psalms" (6, 32, 38, 51, 102, 130, 143) as particularly suited for confession and repentance. We will walk through five of these as part of our daily practice.</p> 
												<ul>
													<li><strong>Psalm 38:</strong> Read and meditate</li>
													<li><strong>Prayer:</strong> From the CRC Psalter Hymnal</li>
												</ul>
												<blockquote>
													Most holy and merciful Father,<br><br>
													We confess to you and to one another,<br>
													that we have sinned against you<br>
													by what we have done,<br>
													and by what we have left undone.<br><br>
													We have not loved you with our<br>
													whole heart and mind and strength.<br>
													We have not fully loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
													We have not always had in us the mind of Christ.<br><br>
													You alone know how often we have grieved you<br>
													by wasting your gifts, by wandering from your ways.<br><br>
													Forgive us, we pray you, most merciful Father;<br>
													And free us from our sin.<br>
													Renew in us the grace and strength of your Holy Spirit,<br>
													for the sake of Jesus Christ your Son our Savior.<br><br>
													Amen.

													Don't consider what we have made of ourselves,<br>
													but what He is making of us for you our God.<br><br>
													O that Christ may be "wisdom and righteousness, sanctification and redemption"<br>
													to every one of our souls.<br>
													May His precious blood cleanse us from all our sins,<br>

													in a world that has yet to feel<br>
													the warmth of your embrace.<br><br>
													But we fail to heed your call,<br>
													draw back from those in need,<br>
													say nothing when we see<br>
													injustice.<br>
													Become invisible.<br><br>
													Forgive us, you whose love<br>
													is better than life,<br>
													you whose Grace extends to all.<br>
													Forgive us, and enable us<br>

													on the lips of all people.<br><br>
													Amen
