											<h3>Opening Reflection Questions</h3>
											<p>Take a moment to consider: <strong>What comes to mind when you hear the word "repentance"?</strong> How would you describe your own experience with repentance—both the easy moments and the difficult ones? What aspects of repentance have challenged or deepened your spiritual journey?</p>

											<h3>The Language of Repentance</h3>
											<p>The Hebrew word for repentance is <em><strong>teshuvah</strong></em>, which literally means "to turn" or "to return" or—a complete change of direction back toward God. It is often used in the context of prophetic calls to repentance. Hebrew also has the word <em><strong>nacham</strong></em>, which means to be sorry, regret, or relent. It can be used of people and even of God (e.g., 1 Sam 15:11) and can suggest either a change in intent or simply an expression of sorrow. The Greek New Testament uses <em><strong>metanoia</strong></em>, meaning "a change of mind" or "afterthought"—not merely feeling sorry, but a fundamental transformation of thinking that leads to a changed life. As we discuss and practice repentance, let's try to remember to draw upon this rich constellation of ideas.</p>

											<h3>Augustine's Framework</h3>
											<p>In his <em>Confessions</em>, St. Augustine provides a profound framework for true repentance that begins with revelation rather than introspection: first, recognizing the holiness of God; second, confessing the heinousness nature of our sin in light of His holiness; and finally, embracing God's grace and loving forgiveness through Christ. Notice the order—repentance starts with seeing God rightly, not seeing ourselves rightly. It ends not in despair but in reveling in the grace of God.</p>

											<h3><a href="readings/finney_true_and_false_repentance.html" target="_blank">True and False Repentance</a></h3>
											<p>We'll begin our exploration with Charles Finney's lecture, reading the <a href="readings/finney_true_and_false_repentance.html#introduction" target="_blank">introduction</a> and <a href="readings/finney_true_and_false_repentance.html#change-of-heart" target="_blank">"A Change of Heart"</a> sections together now. This will set the foundation for our week of practice, where we'll discover that genuine repentance produces not mere regret, but a fundamental reorientation of our hearts toward God.</p>

											<h3>A Note on Journaling</h3>
											<p>Throughout our journey together, I encourage you to keep a notebook dedicated to your interMission experience. This isn't meant to be burdensome—simply jot down insights that strike you, questions that arise, or moments when God seems to be speaking. This will, hopefully, encourage synthesis of your experiences over time and prepare you for sharing with our community each week.</p>

											<h3>Opening Reflection Questions</h3>
											<p>Are you familiar with the concept of a rule of life? If so, what sort of connotation does it have for you? Have you ever written a rule of life? If so, what catalyzed that process and how was the experience of creating it. How was the experience of living it?</p>

											<h3>Definitions</h3>
											<p>"A Rule of Life is a trellis that helps us abide in Christ and become more fruitful spiritually. It is an intentional, conscious plan to keep God at the center of everything we do." - <a href = "https://www.emotionallyhealthy.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/RULE-OF-LIFE-WORKBOOK.pdf">Peter Scazzero</a></p>											
											<p>"A rule of life is a set of rhythms and practices we choose to live out in order to make space for our highest priorities, values, relationships, and callings." -- <a href="https://evangelicalcatholic.org/what-is-a-rule-of-life/">The Evangelical Catholic</a></p>

											<p>"A rule of life is a schedule and set of practices and relational rhythms that help us create space in our busy world for us to be with Jesus, become like Jesus, and do what Jesus did—to live "to the full" (John 10v10) in his kingdom, and in alignment with our deepest passions and priorities." -- <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5852ec829f7456cfcc0e1c5a/t/5e17be5d7cba366ace1df6e1/1578614383140/ptw_ruleoflife_workbook_.pdf"> Practicing the Way / Bridgetown Church</a></p>

											<h3>The Rule of Life in Scripture</h3>
											<p>While the phrase "rule of life" may sound foreign to Protestant ears, the concept is deeply biblical. The Torah itself provided a comprehensive rule of life for Israel—structuring their days, weeks, and years around encounter with God. Consider how the Shema commanded: "These commandments that I give you today are to be on your hearts... Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up" (Deuteronomy 6:6-7).</p>

											<p>Jesus himself lived according to intentional rhythms. The Gospels reveal his "rule":</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Jesus regularly sought solitude to pray: "Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed." (Mark 1:35)</li>
												<li>Jesus regularly worshipped in community: "He went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and on the Sabbath day he went into the synagogue, as was his custom." (Luke 4:16)</li>
												<li>Jesus regularly withdrew for rest and renewal: After intense ministry, "But Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed." (Luke 5:16)</li>
												<li>Jesus regularly practiced fasting and taught his followers to do the same: His 40-day fast (Matthew 4:2), plus teaching that assumed his followers would fast (Matthew 6:16-18)</li>
												<li>Jesus regularly participated in remembrance and celebration: Regularly going to Jerusalem for Passover and other feasts</li>
												<li>Jesus regularly shared life in close community: Living, ministering, traveling, and sharing meals with the twelve apostles.</li>
											</ul>

											<p>Notice that Jesus' rule wasn't rigid legalism but a life-giving structure that enabled him to fulfill his mission while maintaining intimacy with the Father.</p>

											<h3>History</h3>
											<p>When learning about rules of life, you will quickly encounter St. Benedict (~480-547 AD), who is considered the founder of Western monasticism. His 'Rule' provided structure for communal monastic life, informing both relationships within the community and individual spiritual formation under the guidance of the abbot.</p>

											<p>Benedict has a compelling story: as a young man of about 20, he fled the moral bankruptcy of Roman society to live as a hermit. Despite being alone in a cave, word of his virtues and character began to spread, eventually attracting a community of disciples. After challenging experiences with this initial community, he founded a monastery at about age 50 that became the foundation of the Benedictine order. Benedict, influenced by earlier Rules, wrote his Rule in his later years—not as abstract theory but as wisdom distilled from decades of communal spiritual living.</p>

											<h3>This Week's Journey</h3>
											<p>This week is simply an introduction. I'm convinced that everyone already has a rule of life—some are just more intentional about it than others. It's also been my observation that those who live with greater intentionality tend to experience more consistent spiritual growth. This week, we'll learn more about rules of life and document what we're already doing. This <em>isn't aspirational</em>; it's observational. After exploring various spiritual practices over the coming months, we'll return to the rule of life to help you craft one that incorporates any helpful resources that you've discovered. But for now, we simply observe and record what we've been doing.</p>

											<h3>A Note on Grace</h3>
											<p>A rule of life is not about earning God's favor or proving our devotion. It's about creating space to receive what God freely offers. As Dallas Willard reminds us, "Grace is not opposed to effort, it is opposed to earning." A rule of life is simply our effort to position ourselves to receive grace.</p>

											<h3>Opening Reflection Questions</h3>
											<p>When you think about Scripture, what's the first thing that comes to mind? What draws you to Scripture, and what, if anything, causes you to neglect it? Consider both the seasons when God's Word felt alive and vibrant, and times when it seemed distant or difficult.</p>

											<h3>The Foundation of Faith</h3>
											<p>Christian faith rests entirely upon God's self-revelation. As creator of all that was, is, and will be, God has left His fingerprints throughout creation. The beauty and glory we witness in the natural world reflects God's own character and, for those with eyes to see, reveals "his invisible attributes" and "eternal power and divine nature" (Romans 1:20). Some theologians also argue that God has also revealed himself through conscience, reason, and the sweep of history itself---all of this is what we call general revelation.</p>

											<p>Yet I have never met, nor have I even heard of, anyone who discovered the Gospel through general revelation alone. The clues embedded in creation, while pointing toward a Creator, cannot lead us to the cross or the glories of the resurrection. Thanks be to God that He has not left us groping in the dark, piecing together fragments of His character from the world around us! By His grace, God has chosen to make himself known specifically for the purpose of redemption.</p>

											<p>The Bible contains God's specific self-revelation. Despite having numerous human authors writing across millennia in various literary genres, Scripture maintains a coherent theme runs throughout: a holy and loving God pursuing and redeeming an undeserving people. This remarkable coherence results from the work of the Holy Spirit, who is the revealer of truth (John 16:13). As Paul reminds Timothy, "All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work" (2 Timothy 3:16-17). Through this inspired revelation, we can know who God is and who we are in relation to him.</p>

											<h3>The Written Word and the Word Made Flesh</h3>
											<p>Let me be clear: we do not worship the Bible, but the God of the Bible. God's ultimate revelation came in the God-Man Christ Jesus, the Word made flesh (John 1:14). It is Jesus who is "the image of the invisible God" (Colossians 1:15) and in whom "all the fullness of God dwelled" (Colossians 1:19). So, the answer to the perennial question "What is God like?" is "God is like Jesus, because Jesus is God." But this leads us to ask, "Who is Jesus?"---which draws us back to engage with the inspired revelation of the written Word.</p>

											<h3>An Invitation to Deeper Engagement</h3>
											<p>Depending on your tradition and spiritual journey, it is possible to follow Jesus faithfully for years while somehow missing the major themes and threads that weave Scripture together. Many believers attend worship services and Bible studies regularly yet remain unfamiliar with entire books of the Bible, much less the overarching narrative that connects Genesis to Revelation. I believe this represents a form of spiritual malnourishment. You can survive and even grow, but you will be stunted because you are not accessing the fullness of what God has deemed to be essential revelation.</p>

											<p>This week, we will explore five distinct yet complementary ways of engaging with Scripture. Each practice offers a different lens through which to encounter God's Word---from reading entire books to diving deep into individual passages, from study to prayer to contemplative meditation. Our goal is not to master techniques but to be equipped with knowledge of various ways to grow through engaging with Scripture.</p>

													<li><strong>John 6:63:</strong> The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you---they are full of the Spirit and life.</li>
													<li><strong>Prayer:</strong> A prayer of St. John Chrysostom</li>
												</ul>
												<blockquote>
													O Lord Jesus Christ, open the eyes of my heart that I may hear your Word, and understand and do your will, for I am a sojourner upon the Earth. Hide not your commandments from me, but open my eyes, that I may perceive the wonders of your Law. Speak unto me the hidden and secret things of your wisdom. On you do I set my hope, O my God, that you shall enlighten my mind and understanding with the light of your knowledge; not only to cherish those things which are written, but to do them; For you are the enlightenment of those who lie in darkness, and from you comes every good deed and every gift.
												</blockquote>
												<ul>
													<li><strong>Exercise: Bible Reading (Part 1)</strong></li>
												</ul>
												
												<p class="indent">We often forget that the Bible is a book of books, and some of those books are meant to be read in a single sitting. Individual verses may speak to us, but focusing exclusively on bits and pieces is likely to leave us ignorant of the original author's main intent. The gospels and epistles are particularly suited for reading at one time. Think about it---if you received a letter from your childhood best friend, wouldn't you read it straight through? Would you skip around and read only certain parts?</p>

												<p class="indent">Today's practice is simple. Pick an epistle and read through it in its entirety in one sitting. Select a place free from distraction, turn off your phone, pray for the presence of the Holy Spirit, and read for the scope of what the author is saying. Why did they write this letter and what are they communicating? Record your observations in your journal.</p>

												<p class="indent">You can pick any epistle you like. If you have no preference, I'd suggest reading 1 Peter and 2 Peter. Since they are letters written to gentile believers living in a culture hostile to their faith, there may be resonance with our own lives and experiences.</p>

													<li><strong>Prayer:</strong> A prayer from the Reformed tradition</li>

												<ul>
													<li><strong>Exercise: Bible Reading (Part 2)</strong></li>
												</ul>
												<p  class="indent">
													While reading through entire books provides invaluable perspective, it's not always practical for daily engagement. A gospel like Luke would take about two and a half hours to read completely---manageable on a retreat, but challenging for regular practice.<br><br>
													There's also value in reading more slowly and deliberately, allowing us to digest what God might be communicating to us. This is where we can engage Scripture in a more intentionally interactive way. There are many approaches; for simplicity, I have selected one called the SOAP method. Normally you would begin with prayer and then select a passage. For this practice, I recommend that you use Ephesians 2:1-10 and follow the outline below:
												</p>

												<p class="indent"><strong>Scripture:</strong> Write down any verses or phrases that strike you.</p>

												<p class="indent"><strong>Observation:</strong> What do you see in the passage? Who is the author and audience? What is the genre? Does the text contain descriptions, imperatives, exhortations, or something else?</p>

												<p class="indent"><strong>Application:</strong> Ask the Holy Spirit to reveal how the passage could be applied to your life. What impact does it make on your beliefs, attitudes, or actions?</p>

												<p class="indent"><strong>Prayer:</strong> Respond to God in prayer. Give thanks for His revelation and how He is applying it to your life. Ask for grace to help you apply this truth.</p>

													<li><strong>Luke 24:27:</strong> And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning Himself.</li>
													<li><strong>Prayer:</strong> A prayer from the Reformed tradition</li>
												</ul>
												<blockquote>
													Living God, help us so to hear your holy Word that we may truly understand;<br>
													that, understanding, we may believe and<br>
													believing, we may follow in all faithfulness and obedience,<br>
													seeking your honor and glory in all that we do;<br>
													through Christ our Lord.<br><br>
													Amen.
												</blockquote>
												<ul>
													<li><strong>Exercise: Personal Bible Study</strong></li>
												</ul>
												<p class="indent">Bible reading as described above is a great spiritual discipline, but there will likely be times when you'll want to go even deeper. When you want to better understand the historical context of the original author and audience, explore the nuance of a critical word or phrase, or understand how Scripture refers to and interprets itself (which it does frequently!), this is Bible study.</p>

												<p class="indent">The best starting point is a good study Bible, which will have insightful introductions to each book, cultural and archaeological insights for specific verses, and footnotes pointing out alternative translations and connections to other passages. In addition, an excellent electronic resource is the Blue Letter Bible (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/">https://www.blueletterbible.org/</a>). Though it has fewer translations than BibleGateway, it provides easy access to cross-references, commentaries, and Bible dictionaries. It also provides Strong's Numbers, which assigns a code to every word in the original languages so you can easily look up their exact meaning and usage in other passages. This a gift to all serious students of the Word of God.</p>

												<p class="indent">For today's exercise, use the <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/">Blue Letter Bible</a> to study Romans 8:1-17. Read through the entire section first, then go back and examine each verse. Is anything confusing or intriguing? Use the 'Cross-Refs' tools to identify verses with related ideas. Use the 'Interlinear' tab to explore other uses of the underlying Greek word for 'free' in Romans 8:2 (hint, click on G1659). Explore the wealth of information available.</p>

												<h3>Practice 4</h3>
												<ul>
													<li><strong>Hebrews 4:12:</strong> For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.</li>
													<li><strong>Prayer:</strong> From the Book of Common Prayer (1552 edition)</li>
												</ul>
												<blockquote>
													Blessed Lord, you have caused all Holy Scripture to be written for our learning - grant us that we may in such a way hear them, read, mark, learn and inwardly digest them; that by patience and comfort of your holy Word, we may embrace and ever hold fast the blessed hope of everlasting life, which you have given us in our Savior Jesus Christ.<br><br>
													Amen
												</blockquote>
												<ul>
													<li><strong>Exercise: Praying Scripture</strong></li>
												</ul>
												<p class="indent">Ideally all of our prayers would be informed by Scripture, but there are also Scriptures that are meant to be prayed and sung---chief among these are the Psalms. When we pray the Psalms, not only are we praying in agreement with the communion of saints across time and place, but we can be confident that we are praying in agreement with God. The Psalms provide an avenue to pour out our joys, sorrows, frustrations, rage, and earnest desires before Him when our own words fail us.</p>

												<p class="indent">Today's exercise is simple: pick a Psalm and pray it aloud. Read it through once first to catch the sentiment, then bring your heart into alignment with that sentiment and pray it to God. Since I cannot know your spiritual state today, I recommend Psalm 27, which is one of my favorites. However, if you know of another Psalm that better suits the current state of your soul, please feel free to pray through that Psalm instead.</p>

												<ul>
													<li><strong>Exercise: Lectio Divina (Divine Reading)</strong></li>
												</ul>
												<p class="indent">
													As with the formation of a rule of life, if you look up <em>lectio divina</em> you will soon encounter references to St. Benedict of Nursia. As you might remember from <a href="readings/rule_st_benedict_selected_chapters.html#chapter-48" target="_blank">Chapter 48</a> of his <em>Rule</em>, manual work was to be interspersed with 'spiritual reading', which in Latin is <em>lectio divina</em>. The spiritual reading in St. Benedict's community was a slow and contemplative reading of Scripture, essentially a meditation. Though Benedict didn't invent this method of prayerful Scripture reading, his name is now permanently attached to the practice.<br><br>
													Just as Bible study differs from Bible reading, and both differ from praying Scripture, it's best to think of <em>lectio divina</em> as a related but distinct spiritual practice. Historically, it has primarily been a communal practice where one individual led others through the steps below. While you're encouraged to try this at home, you might have a richer experience practicing this with others.<br><br>
													Please use Isaiah 40:25-26 to practice <em>lectio divina</em> following the guidelines below. The four traditional steps are noted by their Latin names.<br><br>
													<strong>Preparation:</strong> Turn off devices. Get into a position that combines comfort and alertness. Take a few deep breaths and invite the Holy Spirit to speak to you through Scripture.<br><br>
													<strong><em>Lectio</em> (Reading/Listening):</strong> Select a short passage---ideally a few sentences at most. Read it slowly, deliberately, and aloud, allowing you to interact with Scripture through seeing, hearing, and speaking the Word. Rest for a moment. Did a word, phrase, or image strike you? Read the passage a second time, again slowly and aloud, listening for what calls for attention. You may read a third time to confirm the word, phrase, or image that God impressed upon you.<br><br>
													<strong><em>Meditatio</em> (Meditating):</strong> Take the word or phrase and ruminate on it. If alone, repeat it aloud; if with others, repeat it in your mind. Do this slowly and deliberately. How is this connecting with your life? What is God trying to communicate?<br><br>
													<strong><em>Oratio</em> (Praying):</strong> Take the word, phrase, or image and its connection to your life and bring them before God in prayer. This will be entirely based on what God has been communicating---it could be thanksgiving, praise, grief, repentance, or petition. Simply respond to and interact with God.<br><br>
													<strong><em>Contemplatio</em> (Contemplating):</strong> Cease active prayer and simply rest in His presence. Be still and silent before Him. Gaze upon His beauty and revel in the miracle that the God who created the universe invites you to commune with Him.<br><br>
													<strong>Response:</strong> If you feel convicted during this practice, write it down in your journal with a date by which you will act. Did you feel nudged to ask for or extend forgiveness? Were you convicted to fast? Asked to write an encouraging note? Write it down and do it!

											<h3>Opening Reflection Questions</h3>
											<p>What has been your experience with memorizing God's Word? What might God be inviting you to discover about this ancient practice?</p>

											<h3>A Personal Story of Spiritual Authority</h3>
											<p>When I was still a seminary student in Boston, I had the privilege of meeting Bishop Gilbert Thompson. To this day, I struggle to put into words exactly how to describe him. He simply had presence. A weighty, undeniable spiritual authority surrounded him. You could feel it when he was in the room. And when he prayed, it felt as if heaven itself drew near. Some men quote scripture. The Bishop prayed it. From memory, he'd pray whole paragraphs straight from the Word. That's when I learned that when Scripture is so deeply embedded in your soul that it shapes your prayers, you pray with a different kind of authority—an unwavering confidence that you are praying in alignment with God's will.</p>

											<h3>Scripture Designed for Memory</h3>
											<p>The Old Testament itself reveals God's intention for His words to be memorable. Psalm 119, a great celebration of God's Word, is structured as an acrostic poem—each section beginning with consecutive letters of the Hebrew alphabet, creating a memorable framework for meditation. Throughout the Hebrew Bible, we find parallelism, repetition, wordplay, and rhythmic patterns that make the text not just readable but memorable. While we cannot prove that all the prophets sang their prophecies, we do know that prophecy and music were often intertwined (1 Samuel 10:5-6), suggesting that God's revelations came in forms designed to lodge in human memory.</p>

											<h3>The Practice in Jesus' Time</h3>
											<p>While popular stories about Jewish children memorizing the entire Torah by age 12 are not historically supported, we do know that memorization played a critical role in first-century Jewish life. Jesus himself reveals the fruit of a mind saturated with Scripture. When tempted in the wilderness (Matthew 4), he responds to each temptation not by consulting a scroll but by quoting from Deuteronomy—words clearly treasured in his heart. Throughout his ministry, Jesus weaves Scripture naturally into his teaching, often beginning with "It is written..." and proceeding to quote extensive passages from memory. His final words on the cross echo memorized psalms, showing how deeply God's Word sustained him even in his darkest hour.</p>

											<h3>The Early Church's Practice</h3>
											<p>The early Christians developed systematic memorization practices driven by both devotion and necessity. New Testament manuscripts were rare and expensive, and personal Bible ownership was virtually impossible for ordinary believers. In response, entire communities organized their lives around memorizing Scripture.</p>

											<p>The evidence is remarkable: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origen" target="_blank">Origen's</a> father required him to memorize passages daily from childhood, and Origen is said to have eventually internalized most of both Testaments. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Chrysostom" target="_blank">John Chrysostom</a> memorized the entire New Testament during a two-year retreat. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachomius_the_Great" target="_blank">Pachomian</a> monastic communities required new members to memorize twenty Psalms or two epistles just to join, with the goal of eventually memorizing the entire New Testament and Psalms.</p>

											<p>These feats of memorization weren't exceptional, they were expected. Presbyters were required to know all 150 Psalms by heart. Irish monastics would gather daily to recite the entire Psalter from memory, and medieval monks incorporated memorization into their daily work.</p>

											<h3>Why Memorize Scripture Today?</h3>
											<p>In our age of instant digital access to dozens of Bible translations, why invest the effort required for memorization?</p>

											<p><strong>To resist temptation:</strong> Like Jesus in the wilderness, we need God's truth readily available when facing spiritual attack. As the psalmist declares, "I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you" (Psalm 119:11).</p>

											<p><strong>To be ready for ministry:</strong> When we encounter someone in need, we can offer the living Word of God. Whether evangelizing, encouraging, counseling, or correcting, memorized Scripture equips us for spontaneous ministry.</p>

											<p><strong>To transform our prayers:</strong> When we pray Scripture, we pray with confidence, knowing we're aligned with God's will. Like Bishop Thompson, we can bring heaven near through Spirit-filled, Word-saturated prayer.</p>

											<p><strong>To renew our minds:</strong> Scripture calls us to be "transformed by the renewing of our minds" (Romans 12:2), and modern neuroscience confirms that memorization practices do change brain structure. Through memorizing God's Word, we are participating in the very transformation Paul describes.</p>

											<h3>Wisdom from a Seasoned Practitioner</h3>
											<p>Dr. Andrew Davis, author of "An Approach to Extended Memorization of Scripture", has memorized over 40 entire books of the Bible. He advocates memorizing entire books rather than isolated verses because understanding the context prevents misunderstanding. His practical method emphasizes several key principles:</p>

											<ul>
												<li><strong>Review before adding:</strong> Always prioritize reviewing previously memorized material over learning new verses</li>
												<li><strong>Space your repetition:</strong> Multiple shorter sessions surpass single intensive efforts</li>
												<li><strong>Include verse numbers:</strong> This helps prevent skipping verses and enables quick reference in ministry</li>
												<li><strong>Engage visual memory:</strong> "Read each new verse ten times, covering each word as though photographing it with your eyes"</li>
											</ul>

											<p>This week's exercises follow Dr. Davis' methodology.</p>

											<h3>An Invitation to Begin</h3>
											<p>This week isn't about mastering memorization techniques or feeling overwhelmed by others' achievements. It's about taking a first step, or perhaps returning to a practice you've neglected, with fresh understanding and realistic expectations. Whether you memorize a single verse or entire chapters, the goal remains the same: to hide God's Word in your heart, that it might transform you from the inside out.</p>

											<p>As you begin this journey, be patient with yourself. The saints who memorized entire books didn't achieve this overnight—they built slowly, verse by verse, sustained by the conviction that God's Word is "more precious than gold... sweeter than honey" (Psalm 19:10).</p>

										<h3>Opening Reflection Questions</h3>
										<p>When you think about spending extended time alone with God, what emotions arise? Anticipation? Anxiety? Peace? Restlessness? Something else?</p>

										<h3>The Old Testament Foundation</h3>
										<p>From the very beginning, Scripture reveals that God draws his people into solitude for profound encounters. Moses received the Law while alone for forty days with God on Mount Sinai (Exodus 24:18). After forty days of traveling alone, Elijah discovered God's presence not in wind, earthquake, or fire, but in a gentle whisper (1 Kings 19:12). Psalm 46:10 declares, "Be still, and know that I am God", suggesting that true knowledge of God often comes through the discipline of stillness.</p>

										<h3>The Example of Jesus</h3>
										<p>Before beginning his public ministry, Jesus spent forty days alone in the wilderness fasting and praying (Matthew 4:1-2). This was likely built upon an established practice of seeking solitude. Throughout his ministry, the Gospels reveal his consistent rhythm: "Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed" (Mark 1:35). That this was habitual is made clear when Luke writes, "Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed" (Luke 5:16). Even at the end, when facing the greatest struggle of his life in Gethsemane, he withdrew from even his closest disciples to pray alone. Jesus demonstrates that solitude isn't about escape but about preparation to serve others.</p>

										<h3>The Practices of the Church</h3>
										<p>Anthony the Great, held by many to be the father of Christian monasticism, withdrew to the desert around 270 AD. Following the Roman legalization of Christianity in 313 AD, many believers felt the church was becoming too worldly and sought a more radical expression of faith. Thousands soon joined Anthony in the desert. These 'Desert Fathers' developed a distinctive spiritual philosophy centered on <em>hesychia</em>, or inner stillness, and their practices became the foundation for all Christian monasticism.</p>

										<p>Throughout church history, many of its greatest leaders have followed the pattern of solitude preparing them for service. As we've already learned, St. Benedict spent years alone in a cave before reluctantly accepting disciples and eventually founding the monastic community that would shape Western Christianity for centuries. St. Patrick spent years in captivity and solitude before becoming the apostle to Ireland. Ignatius of Loyola spent nearly a year in solitude praying for hours daily in a cave, which birthed his Spiritual Exercises and the Jesuit movement. And, more recently, Dietrich Bonhoeffer wrote extensively about solitude from his prison cell, and his writings continue to shape Christian discipleship today.</p>

										<h3>Defining the Practice</h3>
										<p>How is the spiritual discipline of solitude and silence different from simply being alone? Many people spend hours by themselves commuting, working in their gardens, or pursuing hobbies, yet never encounter the transformative presence of God.</p>

										<p>Spiritual solitude is the intentional withdrawal from distractions and human companionship to be with God alone. Unlike loneliness, which is involuntary and painful, solitude is chosen and life-giving. As Henri Nouwen observed, "Solitude is the furnace of transformation. Without solitude we remain victims of our society and continue to be entangled in the illusions of the false self." It's not about geographical isolation but about creating sacred space for communion with God.</p>

										<p>Silence, similarly, goes beyond the mere absence of noise. Rather, it is what the contemplative tradition calls "listening with the heart". It is an openness to God's presence that often comes only when we refrain from constant talking and thinking. As François Fénelon wrote, "How can you expect God to speak in that gentle and inward voice which melts the soul, when you are making so much noise with your rapid reflections? Be silent and God will speak again."</p>

										<h3>A Modern Bridge: Carlo Carretto</h3>
										<p>Carlo Carretto (1910-1988) was an Italian Catholic activist who, at age 44, heard God calling him to "leave everything and come with me into the desert." He left for the Sahara and joined the Little Brothers of Jesus in El Abiodh, Algeria. For ten years, Carretto lived among the Tuareg people in a life of prayer, silence and work. During that time he recorded some of his reflections in <em>Letters from the Desert</em>, which gained global readership among those seeking a deeper life of prayer. Later in life, Carretto's ministry focused on what he called "the desert in the city". He sought to help those searching for "union with God, intimacy with the Absolute, joy and peace of heart, the presence of the Invisible One, divine reality, the Eternal One. All of these, in the city."</p>

										<h3>An Invitation</h3>
										<p>This week isn't about becoming a desert hermit or mastering advanced contemplative techniques. It's about taking first steps on a path well worn by Jesus and the saints. Whether you find five minutes of silence in your car before work or an hour of solitude walking in nature, the goal is the same: creating space to receive what God desires to give.</p>

										<h3>For Future Practice</h3>
										<p>If this week has awakened a deeper hunger for solitude and silence, Richard Foster's book <em>Celebration of Discipline</em> is an excellent resource for many of the practices we've covered and will explore. In his chapter on solitude, he offers some concrete suggestions: try going an entire day without words as an experiment; four times a year get away for 3-4 hours to evaluate where you are in life and reorient your life goals; and consider a yearly retreat with no objective other than solitude. Remember, these are simply suggestions from someone who has walked these paths before us.</p>

										<p>Finally, do not lose sight of the purpose of solitude and silence! As Carlo Carretto wrote, "the desert does not mean the absence of men, it means the presence of God."</p>

										<h3>Opening Reflection Questions</h3>
										<p>Consider the rhythms of your week: where do you find true restoration, and what, if anything, makes rest feel difficult or elusive?</p>

										<h3>Biblical Origins</h3>
										<p>The opening chapters of Genesis introduce the concept of rest. After six days of creation, "God rested from all his work" and <em>blessed the seventh day and made it holy</em> (Genesis 2:2-3). Long before the law and the prophets, the sacred pattern of work and rest was built into the created order.</p>

										<p>Later, in the Ten Commandments, this rhythm becomes a covenant command. Israel is told, <em>"Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy... on it you shall not do any work"</em> (Exodus 20:8-10). The Hebrew word <em>shabbat</em> means "to cease" or "to rest," emphasizing the complete stopping of ordinary work. The command is rooted in creation, but when the law is repeated in Deuteronomy, a second reason is given: <em>"Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and that the Lord your God brought you out"</em> (Deuteronomy 5:15). So Sabbath becomes both a remembrance of creation and a celebration of liberation. In other words, Sabbath is not just a break; it's a protest against every Pharaoh that demands endless production. It's a weekly prophetic action stating that we are not defined by what we do, but by who we are in relation to God.</p>

										<h3>Sabbath in Israel's History</h3>
										<p>Despite its central place in the covenant, Israel struggled to observe the Sabbath faithfully. Prophets like Jeremiah warned that neglecting Sabbath would lead to exile (Jeremiah 17:21-27), while Ezekiel, writing from exile, explained that desecration of the Sabbath was one of the reasons for their judgment (Ezekiel 20:12-24). It wasn't until after the return from exile that Sabbath-keeping was enforced and became a pillar of Jewish identity (Nehemiah 13:15-22).</p>

										<h3>Jesus is Lord even of the Sabbath</h3>
										<p>By the time of Jesus, Sabbath observance had acquired a legalistic framework for many Jews. The Pharisees, likely reacting to Israel's pre-exilic failures, added layers of tradition to the words of Scripture. These traditions eventually developed into 39 categories of prohibited work, which help explain why the religious leaders considered it unlawful for Jesus' disciples to pick grain on the Sabbath (Mark 2:24). Jesus confronted the Pharisees directly by declaring, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath. So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath" (Mark 2:27-28). To drive the point home, Jesus then heals (Mark 3:1-5, Luke 13:10-16, Luke 14:1-6, John 5:8-16) and casts out demons (Mark 1:21-28) on the Sabbath. Jesus challenges the religious establishment by reframing Sabbath not as legal burden but as divine gift. He neither abolishes Sabbath nor enforces rigid rule-keeping. Instead, he restores its purpose: human wholeness.</p>

										<h3>Sabbath in the New Testament</h3>
										<p>After the resurrection, Sabbath is rarely discussed in the New Testament epistles. The only direct teaching appears in Paul's letter to the Colossians: <em>"Do not let anyone judge you... with regard to a Sabbath day. These are a shadow of the things to come; the reality is found in Christ"</em> (Colossians 2:16-17). Paul seems to affirm freedom around Sabbath observance, emphasizing that the deeper rest and rhythm are now fulfilled in Jesus himself.</p>

										<h3>Sabbath Through the Centuries</h3>
										<p>The early church, especially in the first few centuries, seems to have gathered for worship on the first day of the week (the Lord's Day) in celebration of the resurrection (see Acts 20:7; 1 Corinthians 16:2). This wasn't originally a replacement for Sabbath, but an added rhythm. Many Christians continued to observe both Saturday and Sunday into the 4th century. Formalized Sunday rest didn't emerge until the 4th century, when Emperor Constantine issued laws limiting work on Sunday (321 AD). Over time, especially in the Western Church, the two concepts began to blur.</p>

										<p>During the Protestant Reformation, approaches to Sabbath varied. Reformers like Calvin resisted strict legalism but still upheld the importance of rest and worship. Puritan traditions later emphasized a highly structured, almost ascetic Sabbath, while the Eastern Orthodox Church has always approached the Lord's Day as a day of joyful celebration of the resurrection, not restriction. In contemporary Christianity, perspectives differ widely; some view Sabbath as a command to be observed weekly, while others see it more as an invitation to rest in Christ.</p>

										<h3>An Invitation, Not an Obligation</h3>
										<p>Years ago, while serving as a missionary in Cambodia, my team leader introduced me to the concept of 'praying and playing' on the Sabbath. Years later I discovered that this idea was lifted from Eugene Peterson, who shared his thoughts on the topic widely across his writing and interviews. Regardless of the source, the combination of the two concepts caught my attention and imagination. I began to think of the Sabbath not only as a day to refrain or cease from work, but also as a day for engaging in activities and relationships that renew and restore my soul.</p>

										<p>This week I invite you to consider the role of Sabbath in your own life. How can you respond to God's invitation to stop, to rest, to remember, and to be restored?</p>

											</ul>
											<p class="indent"><em>Lectio Divina</em> is a contemplative way of reading Scripture (you can review the full method in Week 3, Practice 5). Here's the simple process:<br>
											• <strong>Read</strong> the passage slowly 2-3 times, listening for a word or phrase that draws your attention<br>
											• <strong>Meditate</strong> on that word or phrase, repeating it and letting it connect with your life <br>
											• <strong>Pray</strong> about what God might be saying to you through this word or phrase <br>
											• <strong>Contemplate / rest</strong> quietly in God's presence, simply being with Him</p>
											<ul>
												<li><strong>Reflection Questions:</strong> How does connecting Sabbath to God's own rest in creation inform your understanding of what rest means? How might honoring Sabbath rest for your household, employees, or even animals reflect God's heart for all creation?</li>

										<h3>Opening Reflection Questions</h3>
										<p>How would you describe your current experience of prayer—both the joys and the struggles? Have there been seasons when prayer felt natural and life-giving, and others when it felt dry or difficult?</p>

										<h3>Communion with God through Prayer</h3>
										<p>On our syllabus, the previous weeks were titled "Foundations & Scripture Engagement." This new portion of our time together is called "Communion with God through Prayer." The title encapsulates what I hope we will experience during these weeks together: genuine intimacy with God through prayer.</p>

										<h3>My Introduction to Mystics & Saints</h3>
										<p>In 2001, I took a class at Boston College titled something like <em>Historic Resources for a Contemporary Spirituality</em>. At that point, the only Christian literature I was really familiar with was the Bible. My classmates, however, spoke about medieval mystics as well as Thomas Merton and Henri Nouwen as if they were childhood family friends. From day one, I knew I was out of my league. I was 27 in a room with many people twice my age. I was Protestant and they were Catholic. I was ignorant and they were enlightened. Yet the professor and classmates welcomed me and indulged my curiosities.</p>

										<p>As much as I appreciated our class discussions, what I appreciated more was being forced to read primary sources. With some exceptions, I found myself deeply moved as I engaged directly with what the mystics and saints of long ago had to say. It is my hope that you will have a similar experience as you engage with some of these texts this week and in the weeks to come.</p>

										<h3>The Context of St. Teresa's Ministry</h3>
										<p>Teresa of Ávila was born in 1515 in Ávila, Spain, during the height of the Spanish Golden Age. When she entered the Carmelite Order in 1535, it was a time of great upheaval in the Western Church. The Protestant Reformation began in 1517, and the Catholic Church was responding with reforms, particularly through the Council of Trent (1545–1563). The Spanish Inquisition was active, and mystical experiences—especially those of women—were often met with suspicion. Teresa's own visions and writings were at times scrutinized by Church authorities.</p>

										<p>Beyond her influential spiritual writings, Teresa was a determined reformer. She founded seventeen convents of the Discalced ("barefoot") Carmelites across Spain, emphasizing poverty, simplicity, and deep contemplative prayer. Working alongside St. John of the Cross, she helped launch a parallel reform among male Carmelites. Together, their efforts revitalized the Carmelite order and contributed to the Catholic spiritual renewal of the 16th century.</p>

										<h3>Introducing the Four Waters</h3>
										<p>We begin our focus on prayer with the Four Waters of Prayer because it provides a framework for understanding how the life of prayer develops. When we first begin to take the spiritual life seriously, most of us struggle to make prayer a priority. And even when we do set aside time, we often find that prayer feels surprisingly difficult. We may block out time for God only to discover that we have little to say and even less ability to listen. And, when we've finished, we may feel like we've been talking to the ceiling. Did we somehow miss the whole point? Was God even there? Does prayer even matter?</p>

										<p>I love the honesty of the Four Waters metaphor. At the beginning, prayer <em>is hard</em> and it <em>does feel like work</em>. However, the promise is clearly held out that if you persevere, it gets easier and there is the potential for experiencing spiritual bliss. In this way, St. Teresa Ávila's writing is as hopeful as it is beautiful and realistic.</p>

										<p>The Four Waters of Prayer appears in Teresa's autobiography, <em>The Life of Teresa of Jesus</em>, which she completed around 1565. Teresa wrote it at the command of her confessor and the Inquisition, who were investigating her mystical experiences. The autobiography, therefore, is more of a spiritual testimony and defense of her experience rather than a personal narrative. The manuscript was held by the Spanish Inquisition for years and was only published in 1588, three years after Teresa's death. It soon became foundational in Catholic spiritual direction. In addition to the Carmelites, the Jesuits incorporated Teresa's insights into their own spiritual formation practices.</p>

										<h3>An Invitation</h3>
										<p>As we begin this exploration of the Four Waters, I invite you to consider prayer not merely as an activity you perform, but as a relationship that grows and deepens over time. Remember to give yourself grace! If you find yourself in the "first water" stage of prayer, where it feels like hard work drawing water from a well, do not be discouraged. Know that Teresa spent nearly twenty years in that stage. Instead, allow yourself to be filled with hope and expectation. The God who drew Teresa through seasons of dryness into profound intimacy is the same God who invites you into deeper communion through prayer. The Four Waters remind us that the spiritual life is not about perfection but about patience, persistence, and openness to God's transforming grace.</p>

												<li><strong>Reflection Questions:</strong> Teresa describes this highest form of prayer as coming "when the gardener least expects it." How does this challenge any tendency to try to manufacture spiritual experiences? How does Teresa's physical description of this prayer—the gradual stopping of breathing, the closing of eyes, the loss of outer strength—help you understand that God affects our whole being, not just our minds?</li>
												<li><strong>Integration Question:</strong> What hope or encouragement do you take from Teresa's teaching that the same God who drew her through seasons of dryness into profound intimacy is the God who invites you into deeper communion through prayer?</li>

                                                <h3>Opening Reflection Questions</h3>
                                                <p>Reflect on the last five times you prayed alone. How did you use your body? Were your eyes open or closed? Were you sitting, standing, kneeling, or in another posture? Were you still or moving? Why did you choose those postures? In what ways might they have influenced your sense of connection with God?</p>

                                                <h3>My Journey to Embodied Prayer</h3>
                                                <p>I learned to kneel before God long before I became a believer. As a fidgety kid, sitting through church was challenging, but kneeling stilled me. After coming to faith, I moved away from many traditions, but kneeling in prayer stayed with me. Later, charismatic spaces introduced me to new postures: arms raised in praise and hands open in receptivity. A Pentecostal roommate eventually introduced me to "sucking carpet," the practice of lying prostrate in desperate prayer. For years, I was almost embarrassed that I needed to use my body in prayer. However, learning about the Nine Ways of Prayer showed me that these instincts were not unusual at all, but part of a long-standing tradition that understands physical posture as central to communion with God.</p>

                                                <h3>The Context of St. Dominic</h3>
                                                <p>Dominic de Guzmán (c. 1170–1221) lived during a time of great upheaval in the Church. He encountered widespread heresies like the Cathars, who rejected many core Christian doctrines. While the Church often responded with force, culminating in the violent Albigensian Crusade (1209–1229), Dominic chose a different path: preaching, learning, and prayer.</p>

                                                <p>Around 1206, he began ministering among heretical communities by embracing poverty and simplicity. He walked barefoot, fasted, and slept on the ground, showing that faithful Christians could live with equal conviction and sacrifice. In 1216, his new religious order, the Dominicans, was officially approved. Unlike monks who withdrew from society, Dominicans were mobile, traveling throughout Europe to preach, teach, and establish schools. They combined evangelical fervor with intellectual rigor and deep spiritual devotion. Their members influenced the church for centuries.</p>

                                                <h3>Introduction to The Nine Ways</h3>
                                                <p>The <em>Nine Ways of Prayer of Saint Dominic</em> was written by a friar decades after Dominic's death to preserve his distinctive approach to prayer. Unlike some contemplative orders that emphasized stillness, Dominic sought communion with God with his entire being. Witnesses described him as a man fully engaged physically in prayer: bowing, kneeling, standing with arms outstretched, lying prostrate, etc. Each of the Nine Ways pairs a physical posture with a spiritual intention, shaped by Scripture (especially the Psalms) and the rhythms of the Divine Office (the traditional cycle of daily prayers). They reflect a belief that our bodies can express, and even cultivate, specific spiritual states.</p>

                                                <h3>The Nine Ways in Practice</h3>
                                                <p>The Nine Ways include gestures such as bowing, genuflecting (bending one knee to the ground), raising hands in praise, and lying face down in humility. Some emphasize stillness; others involve movement. Each offers a tangible way to engage with God—not as performance, but as prayer that arises from body, mind, and heart aligned in worship.</p>

                                                <p>These practices are remarkably accessible. Unlike some mystical practices requiring years of preparation, the Nine Ways offer concrete, physical entry points into deeper prayer. They bear witness to the truth that God made us as material and spiritual beings whose entirety exists for communion with Him. The Dominican embodied approach influenced later movements, including Ignatian spirituality, which also engages the imagination, senses, and posture in prayer.</p>

                                                <h3>An Invitation</h3>
                                                <p>The Nine Ways invite us to rediscover something our spiritual ancestors knew well: the body matters in prayer. Living in an age and culture of increasing digital disconnection from our physical selves, Dominic's example offers a healthy reminder that authentic spirituality engages the whole person. This week you are invited to explore how your own body might become a more integral part of your prayer life as you engage in these time-tested ways to pray with your entire being.</p>

These movements cultivate humility and reverence, acknowledging our lowliness before God's greatness.</p>

This posture expresses deep repentance and complete surrender to God's mercy. St. Dominic would remain in this position while praying verses like "God, be merciful to me, a sinner" (Luke 18:13).</p>

You may recall Scripture for contemplation or simply rest in God's presence as you move. St. Dominic often prayed the Divine Office while traveling and found God in the beauty of His creation along the journey.</p>
